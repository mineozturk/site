More people signed up for MOOCs in 2015 than they did in the first three years of the \u201cmodern\u201d MOOC movement (which started in late 2011\u2014when the first Stanford MOOCs took off).\u00a0According to data collected by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Class Central<\/a>, the total number of students who signed up for at least one course has crossed 35 million\u2014up from an estimated 16-18 million <a title=\"Online Courses Raise Their Game: A Review of MOOC Stats and Trends in 2014\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-stats-and-trends-2014\/\">last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Coursera, the largest online course provider in the world (MOOC or otherwise), added 7 million new students to its userbase (and so it now has 17 million students in total).<\/p>\n<p>This is the first time that the MOOC market has grown faster than Coursera. Last year, Coursera was bigger than all other MOOC providers combined, but in 2015 it accounts for slightly less than 50% of all MOOC students.<\/p>\n<p>Coursera, edX, and Udacity are normally known as the big three. FutureLearn, which closed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/futurelearn-13m-investment\/\" target=\"_blank\">2015 on a high<\/a>, had a breakout year, and it now has more students than Udacity; this makes FutureLearn the third largest MOOC provider in the world now. They grew 275% in 2015 and are rapidly approaching the three million user mark.\u00a0Along the way, they also launched what would be the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/education-32721056\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s largest single session of a MOOC<\/a>: 440,000 students signed up for one session of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/3301\/futurelearn-understanding-ielts-techniques-for-english-language-tests\">Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests<\/a>\u00a0course, which was taught by the British Council.<\/p>\n<div><a style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" title=\"Number of Courses vs time\" href=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/88\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%; width: 1569px;\" src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/88.png\" alt=\"Number of Courses vs time\" width=\"1569\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/embed.js\" async=\"\" data-plotly=\"dhawalhs:88\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Compared to\u00a0<a title=\"Online Courses Raise Their Game: A Review of MOOC Stats and Trends in 2014\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-stats-and-trends-2014\/\">last year<\/a>, the growth rate for courses has slightly slowed down from 100% to 75%. Around 1,800\u00a0new courses were announced in 2015, taking the total number of courses announced since the inception of MOOCs to 4,200. Originally, MOOCs started out as college classes that had been put online, but now course creators are adapting their courses to better fit students&#8217; schedules. This means that semester-long courses are being broken down into smaller courses. This makes it\u00a0difficult to capture the growth of the MOOC space in a total number of courses. There are some courses that can be finished within a couple of hours.<\/p>\n<h2>Credentials<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\nThere are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/certificate\">100+<\/a> Specializations, Nanodegrees, and XSeries<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In September 2013, edX was the first provider to go beyond issuing single course certificates. They <a href=\"http:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2013\/mitx-introduces-xseries-course-sequence-certificates-on-edx\">launched their XSeries<\/a> program, which consists of a certificate gained from completing a sequence of courses. Coursera and Udacity launched similar programs in 2014, which are called Specializations and <a title=\"Udacity raises $35 Million, doubles down on Nanodegrees\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-raises-35m-doubles-down-on-nanodegrees\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nanodegrees<\/a> respectively. These \u201cBig 3\u2033 providers are working to establish brand new credentials using their own brands. The aim of these new credentials is to indicate some level of competence for high-demand skills. They charge for these credentials, of course; and though many doubt the value of these credentials, because their signaling value in the marketplace is still being established, quite a few students are choosing to pursue them. Because of this success, both <a title=\"Udacity raises $105M to \u201cDouble the World\u2019s GDP\u201d\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-series-d-105-million\/\">Udacity<\/a> and <a title=\"The MOOC Revolution Evolves: Coursera Secures $49.5M to Expand Specializations\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-series-c-60-million-dollars\/\">Coursera<\/a> raised significant new\u00a0funding in 2015, with the primary aim of creating more of these credentials.<\/p>\n<p>Currently there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/certificate\">100+<\/a> Specializations, Nanodegrees, and XSeries credentials, most of which were created in 2015, and we can expect that number to more than double in 2016. The projections for 2017 and beyond could be exponential. We tracked this trend early, and this enabled us at Class Central to introduce a free credential exploration and rating service called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/certificate\">Credentialing the Credentials<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Subjects<\/h2>\n<div><a style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" title=\"Course Distribution by Subjects\" href=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/77\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%; width: 1569px;\" src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/77.png\" alt=\"Course Distribution by Subjects\" width=\"1569\" \/><\/a><script src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/embed.js\" async=\"\" data-plotly=\"dhawalhs:77\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>In 2015 there was a distinct focus on monetization by MOOC providers. This\u00a0focus has led to an increase in the percentage of courses focusing on the field of technology\u00a0and business.The percentage of Computer Science and Programming courses grew more than 10%. Due to this growth, we had to split the single &#8220;Computer Science and Programming&#8221; subject\u00a0into two different subjects \u2014 Computer Science, and Programming. To learn more about how we categorize these courses, take a look at our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/classcentral\/online-course-taxonomy\" target=\"_blank\">online course taxonomy<\/a>, which we open-sourced earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>This growth in technical and business courses has led to a decrease in the humanities and social science courses, but overall there\u00a0is still a healthy balance of technical and non-technical courses.<\/p>\n<h2>Providers<\/h2>\n<div><a style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" title=\"Course Distribution by Providers\" href=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/84\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%; width: 1569px;\" src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/84.png\" alt=\"Course Distribution by Providers\" width=\"1569\" \/><\/a><script src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/embed.js\" async=\"\" data-plotly=\"dhawalhs:84\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Not much has changed in course distribution. The top three providers by number of courses are still Couresra, edX, and Canvas Network.
