This opened up a wealth of opportunities for web developers to make web applications, and JavaScript was at the frontier of this innovation.<\/p>\n<p>With JavaScript, you can not only send data back and forth between the user and the server, you could also make dynamic websites that adapt themselves to the user\u2019s screen, implement interactive maps and graphs, create animations, and a lot more. Indeed, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.stackoverflow.com\/survey\/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StackOverflow\u2019s 2021 Developer Survey<\/a>, JavaScript has been the #1 most used language for the past 9 years.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, most people and employers looking for developers to build and maintain their website expect people to know JavaScript. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Salaries\/javascript-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,20.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor<\/a>, the estimated average pay for a Javascript Developer is around $107K per year in the US.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

Throughout the course, you\u2019ll learn how to use many other famous libraries and frameworks like Redux, MongoDB, and GraphQL, as well as a superset of JavaScript called TypeScript.<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons why this course ranks so high on this link is due to its active support groups on <a href=\"https:\/\/study.cs.helsinki.fi\/discord\/join\/fullstack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/fullstackcourse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Telegram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To take this course, you\u2019re expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git version-control system.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with the fundamentals of web apps. You\u2019ll be given an overview of the basics of web development, and also discuss the advances in web application development during the last few decades.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll familiarize yourself with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. You\u2019ll start by learning how to render a collection of data, like a list of names, to the screen. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to allow users to submit data in forms and then process the user data in a remote backend server.<\/p>\n<p>The remote backend server can be implemented with a simple REST API in Node.js (or GraphQL if you prefer) by using the Express library. You\u2019ll learn how to validate the submitted data with ESLint and then store the data in a MongoDB database, before deploying your application to the Internet. You\u2019ll also learn how to implement user authentication and authorization so that users can log into your application, as well write unit and integration tests to ensure you encounter no nasty surprises as you work on your web app.<\/p>\n<p>As your application grows larger and larger, you\u2019ll want to manage the state of React applications with the Redux library. You\u2019ll also want to get to know the React router, which helps you divide applications into different views that are shown based on the URL in the browser\u2019s address bar, along with other topics like web hooks.<\/p>\n<p>In the final few parts of the course written by guest developers, you\u2019ll learn how to implement everything you\u2019ve learnt previously in TypeScript, how to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with the React Native framework, how to implement Continuous Integration \/ Continuous Delivery (CI\/CD) systems with GitHub Actions, package code into containers, and finally learn about relational databases.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 140\u2014280 hours long (worth about 5-13 ECTS credits depending on the amount of submitted exercises). You\u2019ll mostly learn from reading the articles and following along with the examples.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding assignments, there are many many exercises that you can complete to put your skills into practice.

By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to create dynamic, responsive web applications.<\/p>\n<p>Some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS would be helpful prior to taking the course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The first part of this course introduces you to the JavaScript programming language. You\u2019ll begin by working through the syntax of JavaScript. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to improve your code quality by learning how to write good comments, debugging, and code-testing. Afterwards the course dives deeper into JavaScript, where you\u2019ll learn how to write object-oriented code in JavaScript to help you simply design websites, write asynchronous code so that multiple lines of code can run at the same time, and more.<\/p>\n<p>The second part of the course is all about the browser. This is especially important if you\u2019re planning on creating websites with JavaScript, since websites can be viewed from all kinds of devices, operating systems, browsers, and aspect ratios. A few key concepts taught in this section is how the Document Object Model (DOM) structures and organizes web pages, and the event-driven architecture that helps you respond to the user\u2019s action dynamically.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course will take 10\u201420 hours to complete.

You\u2019ll design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search for your first project with HTML and CSS.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, you\u2019ll learn about Python, a programming language, and the Django framework, a popular web framework that you\u2019ll use for your site backend to create truly dynamic applications. For your second project, you\u2019ll design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.<\/p>\n<p>SQL is a language used for storing and retrieving data, which is extremely important as websites revolve around sending data back and forth. You\u2019ll learn Django-specific methods that make it easier to interact with SQL databases, which you\u2019ll apply in your third project where you\u2019ll design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site.<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons why JavaScript is frequently used for web programming is due to its support for Event-Driven Programming, a programming paradigm that centers around the detection of events, and actions that should be taken when an event is detected. You\u2019ll create friendly user interfaces with JavaScript in your fourth and fifth project, designing a front-end for an email client and a Twitter-like social network website.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in the last two sections of this course you\u2019ll learn about testing your websites using CI\/CD to make sure updates to web pages proceed smoothly, and scalability and security to make sure our websites can be accessed by many users at once, and that they are safe from malicious intent. For your capstone project, you\u2019ll apply everything you\u2019ve learned throughout the course and create a web application of your own with Python and JavaScript.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is made up of 9 sections and takes around 72 to 108 hours to complete. You\u2019ll learn by watching the video lectures and reading the supplied course notes.<\/p>\n<p>There are 6 excellently-designed projects in this course that you\u2019ll have to complete to get a <b>free certificate<\/b>.

This entails that you learn how JavaScript works under the hood and how to write good code that tends to bug less. You\u2019ll also cover more advanced concepts like objects and object literals, function expressions, immediately invoked function expressions, and more. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to build your own JavaScript framework or library as well!<\/p>\n<p>To take this course, you\u2019ll need to have some basic experience with Javascript (variables, loops, and functions).<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by answering a fundamental question: How does the JavaScript engine execute code? You\u2019ll answer this question by studying execution contexts and how lexical environments identify the scope between each line of code. Then, you\u2019ll study the different types and operators in JavaScript, including the infamous triple equals === comparator.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll study how object-oriented programming can be achieved with JavaScript through prototypal inheritance. You\u2019ll learn what JavaScript treats as objects and a couple of topics like the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;\/code&gt; keyword, function overloading, and closures.<\/p>\n<p>The course ends with an examination of the famous framework jQuery, as a lot can be learnt from reading other people\u2019s good code. You\u2019ll take your lessons and apply them when you create your own JavaScript framework.<\/p>\n<p>There are also a few extra lectures on TypeScripts, ECMAScript 6, and ES6 if you are interested in them.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 12 hours long, consisting of 13 sections and a total of 88 lectures. You\u2019ll study primarily from watching the lecture videos and from the course material provided. There are no practice exercises in this course.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Udemy<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Anthony Alicea<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Intermediate<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>12 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>175K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.7 \/ 5.0 (45K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Anthony has been programming since he was 12 years old, and got into web sites and web application development at 16.
