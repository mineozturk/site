This time, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@suparn\">@suparn<\/a>\u2019s turn to suggest three courses and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@dhawal\">@dhawal<\/a> set up a Google form for a secret ballot. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/socialpsychology-555\">Social Psychology<\/a> (one of Coursera\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-free-certificate-covid-19\/\">free certificate<\/a> courses) was the winner even before <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@ruima\">@ruima<\/a> had cast her vote. The course description sounded promising, with plenty of 5-star reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Suparn very efficiently set up a document with course information and a study schedule. I vowed to keep up with the others after lagging behind in the last course because of a two-week vacation break.<\/p>\n<h1>The Course<\/h1>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74214\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74214\" style=\"width: 882px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cards-question.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-74214 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cards-question.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"882\" height=\"470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cards-question.png 882w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cards-question-300x160.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cards-question-768x409.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74214\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How would you verify that vowels have an even number on the flip side?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>I took my first online course in 2012, and have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\">completed more than 100<\/a> since. As soon as I started Social Psychology, I realized it\u2019s an older course. The heavy workload with a mix of videos, readings, peer-assessed assignments, exhortations to join the discussion forums, and the final exam were indicative of the university-subject style common in early Coursera courses.<\/p>\n<p>More recent courses tend to be shorter, with weekly quizzes often replacing the final exam format. Peer assessments are less common in newer courses. Social Psychology is more like a university course than many I have done lately. Indeed, Professor Scott Plous mentions that \u201dThe exam is intended to be roughly as difficult as an average college-level psychology exam in the United States.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Class Central records show Coursera released the first session of Social Psychology in 2013, and some more recent material has been added.<\/p>\n<p>The course overview mentioned \u201cOur focus will be on surprising, entertaining, and intriguing research findings that are easy to apply in daily life.\u201d It lived up to this promise, with some material appearing to be included because of unexpected or controversial conclusions. For instance, the color changing card trick below is used in the course to playfully illustrate how our expectations influence our perceptions. Many studies were discussed, alongside compulsory and optional resources such as websites, videos, and reading materials.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Colour Changing Card Trick\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/v3iPrBrGSJM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h1>Some Stumbling Blocks<\/h1>\n<p>By the next bi-weekly meeting on 11 November, most of the Study Group had worked through the first week. Some had started on week two. We agreed that it was an interesting course and discussed the Snapshot quiz, a long quiz you take early in the course and whose results are used throughout the course to illustrate aspects of social psychology and some of the tricks our minds play on us. We also discussed whether or not we had joined the Social Psychology Network. Some participants thought the course promoted the Social Psychology Network (which is run by the instructor) a bit too much.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Plous freely admitted in early videos that social psychology findings differ between cultures. As a global study group with members on four continents, we agreed, noting that many conclusions appeared to be biased towards a Western\/American cultural point of view.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74199\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74199\" style=\"width: 914px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/upside-down-effect.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74199\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/upside-down-effect.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/upside-down-effect.png 914w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/upside-down-effect-300x167.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/upside-down-effect-768x429.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74199\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Notice something off in this picture? Try upside down.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Two weeks later, several people had still not finished week two, which featured a time-consuming written assignment. Not only did learners have to write a real or fictitious resume, or a profile on the Social Psychology Network, we also had to explain how we constructed it using elements of social psychology. This assignment was a big stumbling block for several in the group. For learners wanting to take the course, I would recommend going straight to the assignment when you start the week, so you can read what it\u2019s about and start thinking about your response while you watch the lecture videos.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\">I started off well<\/a>, planning to read the readings and conscientiously scrutinize all the optional resources. Each week took hours! After enrolling in late October, I had only fully completed three weeks of the course before Christmas. Then other commitments took over and I didn\u2019t get back to it until late January.<\/p>\n<p>After resetting my Coursera deadlines, I had to make a decision. Should I continue as before and risk taking another two months to finish in between my work and family commitments? Or should I take the quick way and just complete the compulsory work? I was still keen to earn my free certificate. I finally decided to earn my certificate the easiest way, and not attempt the Honors assignment. After all, I can access all the course materials at any time by logging into Coursera. I ignored the optional items, watched the main videos, scanned the readings, and finished the last few assignments and the exam within two titanic weeks.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74196\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74196\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rui-certificate-social-psy.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-74196 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rui-certificate-social-psy-e1612169891256-1024x787.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"787\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rui-certificate-social-psy-e1612169891256-1024x787.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rui-certificate-social-psy-e1612169891256-300x231.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rui-certificate-social-psy-e1612169891256-768x591.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rui-certificate-social-psy-e1612169891256.png 1043w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74196\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@ruima\">@ruima<\/a>&#8216;s course certificate<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Others fared differently. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@vishnu\">@vishnu<\/a> joined a few meetings but didn\u2019t really get started on the course.

During <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/socialpsychology-555\">Social Psychology<\/a>, the group\u2019s learning aspirations fell in a heap, although we enjoyed getting to know each other better during the bi-weekly Zoom catch-ups.
