This has drastically reduced interactivity (aka forum discussions), initially one of the big selling points of MOOCs.<\/p>\n<p>Pat Bowden, a serial MOOC-taker and author of the blog <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinelearningsuccess.org\">www.onlinelearningsuccess.org<\/a> talks about how MOOCs have generally become more flexible in her latest article for <strong>Class Central<\/strong> titled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/five-years-mooc-trends\/\">Five Years of MOOC Trends<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The first MOOCs were essentially college courses put online \u2014 they were approximately ten weeks long and had weekly or bi-weekly assignment deadlines with a final exam. Like a college course, they followed a semester pattern and were offered once or twice a year. Over the years, MOOCs have become shorter and class schedules have become more flexible.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66802\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-increased-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-increased-flexibility.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-increased-flexibility-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-increased-flexibility-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-increased-flexibility-1024x512.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Shorter Courses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A general trend among all MOOC providers is splitting of longer courses into smaller chunks of around four weeks. Many of the courses that were launched back in 2012 or 2013 have been split into multiple courses; what was once a single 12-week course is now 3 courses of four weeks each.<\/p>\n<p>Many of Class Central\u2019s users (Pat Bowden included) find that setting aside a four week block of time to study can be easier than marking off twelve or fourteen weeks. I\u2019ve also found that with shorter courses, broken down into smaller chunks, that I can spread serious learning throughout the year, reduce burn out, and increase my chances of success. I once had to drop out of a tough MIT course in week five of twelve because I couldn\u2019t keep up. Now, thankfully, the course has been broken into three separate courses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Schedules<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Early on, if you missed the start date of the course or you joined in later you might already be too behind to catch up. You would have missed too many hard deadlines.\u00a0 It was also an issue if you were ahead because you would have to wait for the professors to release the next week\u2019s content. No longer.<\/p>\n<p>Most courses are now offered in a self-paced format or, in the case of Coursera courses, offered on a regular schedule, with new sessions starting automatically on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. If a student can\u2019t finish a session, all their work is simply transferred to a new session. This has led to a significant increase in the number of courses students can register for and start almost immediately.<\/p>\n<p>FutureLearn solved the flexibility problem in their own unique way. They increased the enrollment window to 6 weeks after the course ends. Once you sign up, you get access to the course contents for the length of the course plus 14 days. So for a four-week course, the enrollment window will be ten weeks, the duration of the course plus six weeks. Paying students get unlimited access and can finish the course on their own time.<\/p>\n<p>Hard deadlines for assignments and submissions are also a thing of the past. If there is any deadline, it&#8217;s usually the end\/last date of the course.<\/p>\n<p>Providers like Coursera also let you attempt quizzes as many times as you want. After three attempts, you might be locked out of the quiz for 8 hours, but you can try again the following day.<\/p>\n<p>Overall this increased scheduling flexibility is a good thing for learners. The one big downside is that it has made the discussion forums a lot less lively. I sorely miss the camaraderie of those early days. Having support through the discussion forms also helped me finish some the difficult MOOCs that I might not have otherwise completed. My proposal: the concept of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-semester-putting-m-back-moocs\/\">MOOC Semester<\/a>, a way of keeping the flexibility and convenience while bringing back some community interaction.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MOOCs have evolved to better fit learners&#8217;
