The first week is highly interesting and you are very active and motivated. But from week to week your enthusiasm is constantly diminishing. Some unexpected duties drop in and your motivation keeps forfeiting. At a certain point you realize that you have already lost the track and you decide to give in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Does this situation sound familiar to you? Have you ever started a MOOC and capitulated due to different reasons (e.g. personal, professional, and\/or motivational)? You answer in the affirmative? You nod? Don\u2019t be frustrated, you are in good company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"en-US\">MOOCs and their drop-out problem<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">It has often been highlighted that MOOCs suffer from a high drop-out rate or, to put it the other way round, from low completion rates. There are thousands of interested learners who start a MOOC and only hundreds that complete it. Hollands and Tirthali (2014, 42) state that \u201c3% to 15% of all enrollees\u201d complete a course, whereas Jasnani (2013, 6) writes about \u201cthe typical completion rate of below 10%, approximately 7.5%\u201d. The reasons to drop a course are manifold, as Colman (2013) resumes from a survey he conducted. They range from a lack of time, to the fact that participants are just interested in parts of a MOOC or signed up for it because they were curious about the MOOC or its topic but didn\u2019t want to complete the course. Some of the interviewed people just completed parts of the MOOC and some dropped it because they were disappointed e.g. of the (instructional) course design, unexpected costs or technical problems. Others feel overwhelmed by the different requirements asked for in the MOOC or the information overload they cannot cope with. Others, finally, are not used to learn in a self-autonomous and self-regulated way and do not have appropriate learning strategies or competences to \u201csurvive\u201d a MOOC journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"en-US\">Week 4 is crucial<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">What we have found out using Learning Analytics (LA) to collect and use the data of three of our courses at the Austrian MOOC platform iMooX (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imoox.at\">www.imoox.at<\/a>) is that there seems to be a specific \u201ccrucial point\u201d within a course that can be seen as a drop-out-point: week 4. In our paper <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">MOOCs as granular systems: design patterns to foster participant activity<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> (Lackner et al. 2015) we attempted to answer the question at which point of an xMOOC learners decide whether they will more likely complete or quit the course. LA as an interaction analysis of educational data aims at understanding and consequently improving learning behavior (Greller et al. 2014). Using LA to gather the enormous amount of data that arises within courses with a huge number of participants means to gather data from different sources behind the scenes. The participants do not know that their behavior is being tracked and act in a natural way. The collected data consists of different activities, such as, for example, simple log files, the number of posts written in discussion forums or the, the number of read posts (written by their colleagues). Additionally we could see how often the participants did the quizzes and which questions caused difficulties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">We observed two interesting aspects analyzing the data of our three courses:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">a. Talking about completion rates and student activity has to be done in a differentiated way. There are three numbers that have to be considered: enrolled participants, active participants and \u201ccompleters\u201d. Figure 1 might help to visualize these different types of participants:<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Students-Summary-in-MOOCs-2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61617\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Students-Summary-in-MOOCs-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Students Summary in MOOCs-2\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Students-Summary-in-MOOCs-2.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Students-Summary-in-MOOCs-2-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><em>Figure 1: Different types of MOOC p<\/em><i>articipants<\/i><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">An active participant is a participant who, at least, did one quiz or wrote one forum post within the course. A certified student passed all quizzes with at least 75% right answers and did a final feedback survey at the end of the course. Looking at the chart, you can identify a huge gap in our courses between those registered and those who completed the course or even got the confirmation of participation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Let\u2019s take a closer look at the course <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">Gratis Online Lernen 2014<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> to nail this observation down: Calculating the completion rate on the basis of the registered participants, it amounts to 21.44% (with a certification rate of 17.49%). If we take the active participants as our sample, the completion rate is 45.30% and the certification rate 36.95%. The numbers double. [If you are interested in a more detailed analysis, you find different tables and visuals in our paper <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/277890739_MOOCs_as_granular_systems_design_patterns_to_foster_participant_activity\"><span lang=\"en-US\">MOOCs as granular systems: design patterns to foster participant activity<\/span><\/a><span lang=\"en-US\">.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">b. The \u201cdrop-out point\u201d in these three courses lies between the fourth and fifth week. Whereas the participants are highly active within the first (and even the second) week, their activity starts decreasing in week three and stays then, after week four, more or less constant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"en-US\">Lessons learned<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">It is evident that our study provides only first results and is therefore biased. There are specific circumstanced that have to be considered: The Austrian MOOC platform offers, for example, only courses in German language and most of the participants have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree (Neub\u00f6ck et al. 2015). Nevertheless, keeping these first results in mind, the (instructional) course design of xMOOCs has to be reconsidered. It has already been stated that MOOCs need a special and elaborated instructional design (Guardi\u00e0 &amp; Sangr\u00e0 2013; Hayes 2015; Jasnani 2013; Kopp &amp; Lackner 2014; Richter 2013) as the course design is a crucial factor when deciding whether to complete or quit a MOOC, as Colman (2013) has shown. Here are three simple tips that might help to increase the completion rates of a MOOC:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">1. Many of the MOOCs provided by well-known institutions, for example Coursera (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coursera.org\">www.coursera.org<\/a>), edX (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.edx.org\">www.edx.org<\/a>), FutureLearn (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurelearn.org\">www.futurelearn.org<\/a>), Mooin (<a href=\"https:\/\/mooin.oncampus.de\">https:\/\/mooin.oncampus.de<\/a>) or iversity (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.iversity.org\">www.iversity.org<\/a>), last six to ten weeks. As we have seen, the \u201cdrop-out-point\u201d \u2013 at least in the courses we scrutinized \u2013 can be identified between week four and week five. So a more granular course design should be taken into consideration. Think granular and design four-week courses. Split the content into different parts and offer rather a series of two or three MOOCs each lasting four weeks than one twelve-week MOOC (Hollands &amp; Tirthali 2014, 92; Jasnani 2013, 14). [A tendency to offer shorter MOOCs can already be spotted when browsing different platforms. This tendency seems to be rather new as the first MOOCs mostly had an eight-week structure.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">2. Many participants do not want to do the entire course, are interested in some pieces of information or do not intend to get a certificate. To make their learning outcomes visible, implement a badge system (CEDEFOP 2009; Sch\u00f6n et al. 2013). Badges showcase the learning process. Even if participants do not want to have a certificate for the course, they may want to earn a badge on a specific topic, unit or part of the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">3. Learners might overcome the drop-out-point when suspense is high or they interact actively (Khalil &amp; Ebner 2014). Use traditional ways of creating suspense, stemming from narration (Bakker 2013), to sow the desire within your learners to \u201cstay tuned\u201d. Create different suspense peaks so the participants \u201chave to\u201d come back to the course to get the missing information or the solution of a (hidden) riddle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">These three lessons might help all those who want to design a MOOC to do it in way that participants stay tuned. All others interested in MOOCs and participating in MOOCs might see this post as an incentive to rethink their own behavior. When do you decide to quit a MOOC? Why do you drop out of a course? Are you an enrolled or an active participant who drops the course?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"en-US\">List of references<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Bakker, E. J. (1993).
