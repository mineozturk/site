In early May, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/13\/lambda-school-lawsuits\/\">three former students sued the school<\/a>.

The name Lambda School is a case in point: Lambda is a reference to a function programming concept, and Lambda School\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190127150150\/https:\/twitter.com\/AustenAllred\/status\/1049763690138849285\">originally<\/a> was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160816220132\/http:\/\/lambdaschool.com:80\/\">intended to be an online Haskell textbook<\/a>. The pivot from an interactive online textbook to a full fledged coding bootcamp was the first of many major changes to Lambda\u2019s educational structure.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Lambda School joined YCombinator, a prominent startup accelerator. At this point, Lambda School\u2019s curriculum <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20171015132927\/https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/\">was advertised as<\/a> \u201ca small class undergoes live, intensive online training.\u201d Lambda\u2019s website promised students \u201cfrequent code reviews from knowledgeable instructors\u201d and that the education would be \u201cJust like a physical classroom experience\u201d despite taking place online.<\/p>\n<p>After receiving funding, Lambda School scaled up and rapidly grew its enrollment. But a larger student body meant it was harder for Lambda to continue to provide small class sizes. By the beginning of 2020, Lambda School had developed a new model where each instructor was assigned to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/2\/11\/21131848\/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free\">upwards of sixty students<\/a>, a far cry from the small classes promised at the beginning. But students were also assigned to a \u201cteam lead\u201d, a former student who was paid about thirteen dollars an hour to assist with instruction. This model helped cut costs while still allowing students to have regular contact with some sort of an instructor.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Year<\/td>\n<td>Lambda School Alumni (per LinkedIn as of May 14, 2021)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2017<\/td>\n<td>120<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2018<\/td>\n<td>777<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2019<\/td>\n<td>2,714<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2020<\/td>\n<td>2,847<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Lambda School\u2019s growth relied in part on launching new programs in foreign countries and in professions that were unfamiliar with a coding bootcamp education model. In 2019, Lambda School was reportedly considering <a href=\"https:\/\/yourstory.com\/2019\/09\/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-india-education\/amp\">expanding to India<\/a>, having already launched programs in <a href=\"https:\/\/paystack.com\/lambda\">Africa<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursereport.com\/blog\/lambda-schools-europe-income-share-agreement\">the UK and the EU<\/a>. Lambda School expanded from its web design program and launched programs in User Experience, Data Science, iOS development and Android development. At one point, Lambda School was also reportedly considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/business\/2019\/04\/27\/lambda-an-online-school-wants-to-teach-nursing\">buying a nursing college<\/a> and launching programs unrelated to software engineering.<\/p>\n<p>The rapid pace of growth proved hard to maintain and many of Lambda\u2019s expansions have since been rolled back. A Lambda nursing school has yet to materialize, and Lambda\u2019s new programs, such as its user experience program, were the subject of negative articles in the media. In particular, Lambda School\u2019s User Experience curriculum was the subject of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/2\/11\/21131848\/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free\">a Verge<\/a> article where students alleged that the curriculum was plagiarised and that instructors were ill equipped to teach the course. Today, Lambda appears to have shut down many of its programs, and its website only <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/faq\">advertises<\/a> two programs: one in data science and one in full stack web development (with a Backend Development bootcamp \u201ccoming soon\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>In general, the period between 2019 and 2020 was when Lambda School began to see a steady stream of <a href=\"https:\/\/hashtagcauseascene.com\/podcast\/jonathan-martinez\/\">criticism<\/a> from the media as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keziyahl\/status\/1155154616281178114?lang=en\">anonymous<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/codequeenj\">accounts<\/a> on social media, as well as its <a href=\"https:\/\/redd.it\/nbrwra\">own<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/redd.it\/nn3ygq\">subreddit<\/a>. Beginning with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-y-combinator-cult-2019-10\">an article from Business Insider<\/a>, and continuing with articles from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/2\/11\/21131848\/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free\">The Verge<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2020\/02\/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html\">New York Magazine<\/a>, the articles detailed student complaints with the instruction, with the rapidly changing nature of the curriculum, and the quality of education more generally. In February 2020, New York Magazine alleged that Lambda School had fraudulently inflated its outcomes metrics, and that roughly half of all students received jobs, a claim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/are-isas-affordable\/\">substantiated by investor documents<\/a> which claimed that 53% of all enrolled students received jobs.<\/p>\n<p>One month later, the coronavirus pandemic reached the US. The impact on online education companies was immediate, with companies like Coursera and EdX seeing huge increases in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/surging-interest-in-online-education\/\">online traffic<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-q1-2021\/\">revenue<\/a>. But for Lambda School, despite being an online education company, the challenges were just beginning.<\/p>\n<h2>Elimination of Team Leads<\/h2>\n<p>On September 21st 2020, Lambda School introduced a new program called \u201cLambda Leadership.\u201d On Lambda School\u2019s website, Lambda Leadership was <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/lambda-leadership\">portrayed as<\/a> a way to provide \u201copportunities for all students to build fundamental leadership skills.\u201d But Lambda Leadership also included several changes to Lambda\u2019s curriculum. These changes included shortening the curriculum to <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/the-commons\/announcing-job-search-instruction-and-program-length-changes-to-the-lambda-school-curriculum\">six months<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/how-we-learn-lambda-income-sharing-agreements\/\">nine months<\/a>, which was a change that applied retroactively to students still enrolled in the program, per an internal FAQ examined by Class Central. Students were technically given the option to \u201copt out\u201d of the shortened curriculum, per that same FAQ, but the FAQ also was unclear about when that option would be available (\u201cAvailable to students once we&#8217;ve launched this program.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shortened-school-faq.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-75762 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shortened-school-faq.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"711\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shortened-school-faq.png 711w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shortened-school-faq-300x253.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another change involved getting rid of paid team leads (aka TLs, or former students who assisted with instruction). This change had a particularly significant impact on grading, as the team leads were previously responsible for grading. To compensate, Lambda School announced that they would replace TL assigned scores with \u201cself assessments,\u201d per the copy of the FAQ. In effect, students would be grading themselves. The FAQ justified the change by claiming \u201cit&#8217;s not about us testing you or giving you a score or grade, it&#8217;s about working with you to understand where you are, where you need help, and what happens next.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/lambda-leadership-who-grades.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-75763 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/lambda-leadership-who-grades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/lambda-leadership-who-grades.png 578w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/lambda-leadership-who-grades-278x300.png 278w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In place of the team leads, Lambda School announced that they would move to a peer mentorship model. In this model, students would <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/lambda-leadership\">meet regularly<\/a> with a student two units ahead of them as well as a student two units behind them. Notably, unlike the Team Leads, student mentors were not paid.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the change, Lambda School <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/the-commons\/announcing-job-search-instruction-and-program-length-changes-to-the-lambda-school-curriculum\">promised<\/a> to more than double the instructional staff. This would have been aided by shortening the length of the program: with a six month program each instructor could teach two cohorts of students a year instead of one and a half cohorts they taught previously.<\/p>\n<h2>Aligned Incentives<\/h2>\n<p>One of Lambda School\u2019s selling points was that students could finance their education through the use of Income Share Agreements (ISAs). In Lambda\u2019s ISA, students agreed to give Lambda a percentage of their income for a specified number of years, in exchange for Lambda paying for the students\u2019 education. Income Share Agreements aren\u2019t new &#8212; Yale first introduced the product in the 1970s &#8212; but Lambda helped popularize the idea years later.<\/p>\n<p>Lambda\u2019s ISA has a number of selling points. Lambda claimed (and <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/faq\">still claims<\/a>) that its ISA is not debt and that its ISA allows students to attend without taking on additional debt. Lambda also claimed that its ISA allowed Lambda to align its financial incentives with the incentives of students to get a job. Because Lambda is paid a percentage of its graduates&#8217; salaries, theoretically if its graduates got jobs and made more money after graduating, Lambda would theoretically make more money.<\/p>\n<p>The terms of Lambda\u2019s ISA include some safeguards. In Lambda\u2019s ISA, students need to make a minimum income each month before they are on the hook for the payments. Lambda\u2019s ISA also has a cap, or a maximum total amount students can pay, as well as a maximum length after which the agreement expires. Finally, Lambda\u2019s ISA claims that students will only need to make payments if they are working in a field related to what they studied.<\/p>\n<p>The terms of Lambda\u2019s ISA are as follows. Students agree to pay\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/isa\">17% of their income<\/a> during months where they earn more than $4,167 per month, for a maximum of 24 months. If a student pays more than $30,000 in total, or if a student has graduated more than five years ago, the agreement expires.<\/p>\n<p>But Lambda\u2019s ISA has led to controversy. According to the New York Magazine, at one point Lambda was <a href=\"https:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2020\/02\/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html\">directly selling its ISAs<\/a> to an investor in exchange for a flat fee per ISA. This means that while long term Lambda might have an incentive to ensure the ISAs did well so investors would continue to buy ISAs, in the short term Lambda wouldn\u2019t see any direct financial impact from the job placement outcomes of their students. Lambda for its part has <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/the-commons\/announcing-our-new-isa-financing-blueprint-and-100m-in-new-financing\">announced a more complicated financing relationship<\/a>, but questions still remain to what extent the incentives are aligned.<\/p>\n<p>And many questions can be asked about the affordability of ISAs like Lambda\u2019s. Lambda\u2019s ISA has an advantage over student loans in that if borrowers don\u2019t have a job they don\u2019t have to pay. But unlike student loan borrowers, borrowers with ISAs are <a href=\"https:\/\/protectborrowers.org\/isa-prepayment-blog\/\">barred from refinancing their ISAs<\/a> to take advantage of lower interest rates. Comparisons between ISAs and loans are difficult because they use different metrics (e.g. loans publish interest rates), but the math suggests that students with ISAs may pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/are-isas-affordable\/\">significantly more overall<\/a> than students with loans.<\/p>\n<p>At least one US state &#8212; California &#8212; has taken aggressive action to limit the availability of ISAs in the state. As a condition to get approval to operate in California, in 2020 Lambda <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/the-commons\/lambda-school-approved-bppe-california\">agreed to discontinue its ISA offering<\/a> for students in California.<\/p>\n<h2>\u201cBut long term it doesn\u2019t matter, so keep going.\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>From the end of April to the beginning of May, Lambda School faced a rapid series of setbacks. On April 26, Lambda School reached a <a href=\"https:\/\/dfpi.ca.gov\/2021\/04\/26\/lambda-school-reaches-settlement-with-dfpi-agreeing-to-end-deceptive-educational-financing-practices\/\">settlement<\/a> with a California consumer protection agency. Three days later, on April 29, Lambda School laid off <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/the-commons\/update-lambda-school-team\">sixty five<\/a> employees and announced that they were suspending enrollments in their part time programs. The layoffs included several employees in student-facing roles, such as career coaches who played a large role in helping graduates land jobs, according to LinkedIn profiles reviewed by Class Central. Finally, on May 13, three former students <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/13\/lambda-school-lawsuits\/\">initiated a lawsuit<\/a> against Lambda School.<\/p>\n<p>Lambda School is a company that personifies the Silicon Valley ethos of move fast and break things. For example, when announcing the peer mentorship structure, Lambda\u2019s ex-President Caleb Hicks told students that \u201cOne of my favorite things about being at Lambda instead of a traditional school is that we can move quickly. While it&#8217;s hard to move as quickly as we could when we were 10-20 people, we can iterate and improve on a week over week and month over month basis.\u201d (On June 1st, Hicks became the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/calebhicks\/status\/1399797155741667330\">latest Lambda executive to depart from the company<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/caleb-screenshot-of-screenshot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-75765 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/caleb-screenshot-of-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/caleb-screenshot-of-screenshot.png 790w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/caleb-screenshot-of-screenshot-300x230.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/caleb-screenshot-of-screenshot-768x589.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Lambda\u2019s mission to reinvent education has won it the support of prominent Silicon Valley investors like Paul Graham, who stuck with the school despite outside criticism. A year ago, in response to criticism, Allred posted a message to the Lambda School Slack channel ostensibly from Paul Graham (Paul Graham later published a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/fh.html\">blog post containing similar language<\/a>). \u201cIf you (a) do something really novel and (b) it becomes successful enough, you will gradually accumulate haters,\u201d Graham\u2019s message read. \u201cBut long term it doesn\u2019t matter, so keep going.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-paul-graham-screenshot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-75766\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-paul-graham-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-paul-graham-screenshot.png 642w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-paul-graham-screenshot-300x264.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Like many other companies in Silicon Valley, Lambda School has struggled with diversity, equity, and inclusion. In a Slack message during the summer of 2020, Allred admitted that &#8220;In many ways, we have failed to build a staff that reflects the diversity of our student community. We have also failed to deliver a diversity report, one that you have asked for. There are a number of reasons as to why this is true, but I know you don&#8217;t want to hear excuses. I have made this a priority for my staff.&#8221; (Lambda School subsequently did release a <a href=\"https:\/\/lambdaschool.com\/the-commons\/building-an-inclusive-future-2020-diversity-at-lambda-school\">diversity report<\/a> in July of 2020.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-diversity-report-screenshot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-75767\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-diversity-report-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-diversity-report-screenshot.png 744w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/austen-diversity-report-screenshot-300x232.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Unlike some competing coding bootcamps, Lambda School has eschewed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highereddive.com\/news\/more-colleges-are-partnering-with-boot-camps-to-tap-demand-for-short-term-p\/594295\/\">partnerships with traditional universities<\/a> and opted to develop its programs on its own. On twitter, Allred compared accreditation, a process by which schools in the US get approval to receive funding for the federal government, <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210515000313\/https:\/\/twitter.com\/Austen\/status\/1078149294849290240\">to taxi medallions<\/a>.
