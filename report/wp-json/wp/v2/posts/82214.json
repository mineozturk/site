In short, if you complete their program, duly apply for jobs, but still can\u2019t get one, they promise to refund you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is an oversimplification. These policies come with a lot of fine print. And we know that when it comes to money, some platforms don\u2019t mind engaging in questionable practices, as previously reported by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class Central<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/bootcamps-and-isas\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bootcamps and ISAs: Economics, Challenges, and Opportunities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So job guarantees can raise eyebrows.

I\u2019m approaching these policies as an online learner myself, not as a legal expert. I\u2019m likely to miss some things and misunderstand others.

To get a refund, you have to satisfy a number of conditions. These can typically be broken down into four phases:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Preconditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Conditions that must be met even before starting the program. For instance, the learner must live in a country where the job guarantee policy is available.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Study Conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Conditions that must be met during the study period. For instance, the learner must successfully complete the program for the job guarantee policy to kick in.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Job Search Conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Conditions that must be met during the job search period. For instance, the learner must apply to a certain number of jobs every week.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Refund Conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Conditions that must be met when the search period ends to be entitled to a refund. For instance, the learner must ask for the refund within 30 days.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, let&#8217;s discuss specific job guarantee policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"openclassrooms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenClassrooms Job Guarantee<\/span><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_82218\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82218\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/openclassrooms-homepage.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82218\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/openclassrooms-homepage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"581\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/openclassrooms-homepage.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/openclassrooms-homepage-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/openclassrooms-homepage-768x436.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-82218\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/openclassrooms.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenClassrooms homepage<\/span><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The French online education platform OpenClassrooms offers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/provider\/openclassrooms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and professional certificates in topics such as web development, digital marketing, and IT, most entailing a year of full-time study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These professional certificate programs come with a job guarantee policy, which OpenClassrooms calls \u201cHired or Refunded.\u201d You can find the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openclassrooms.com\/en\/terms-of-sale#hired-or-refunded\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">policy terms here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

This can seem surprising, since job opportunities can vary wildly from country to country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I imagine they\u2019re comfortable offering a worldwide job guarantee because their policy is process-oriented and the process is intense enough to work in most markets. And when it doesn\u2019t, the policy has a significant contingency: it requires learners to be mobile, even willing to relocate to a neighboring country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of <\/span><b>study conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the requirement is simple: successfully complete the professional certificate program. The learner\u2019s job search period starts right after their last assignment is validated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of <\/span><b>job search conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the policy entails quite a bit. During 6 months, learners must:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Apply<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to at least 10 jobs per week.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Attend<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> weekly coaching sessions with an OpenClassrooms adviser.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Take<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an extra course and complete its projects, to facilitate the job search.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Report<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to OpenClassrooms every 15 days, detailing all the applications sent, companies and people contacted, communications that took place, and potential job offers received.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of <\/span><b>refund conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as you\u2019d expect, the main condition is to still be without a job by the end of the job search period. But it\u2019s not just that. In order to be entitled to a refund, the policy also requires the learner to not have rejected or left unanswered a valid job offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that\u2019s the policy in a nutshell. Now what do we make of it? Here are some of the aspects that caught my eye when reading the policy, and that I think every prospective learner ought to be aware of:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Self-employment counts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If after completing the program, you start a business, then you won\u2019t be entitled to a refund. This can seem sensible. But depending on where you live, creating a business can be a simple process. And no matter where you live, business success isn\u2019t guaranteed. So if you plan to be self-employed, keep in mind it would likely mean becoming ineligible for a refund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Refund cap<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Most OpenClassrooms programs cost $300 per month, and they take 12 months of full-time work to complete. But that\u2019s on average. Some students may take significantly longer. However, OpenClassrooms will only refund the mean program cost. So if you take 18 months ($5400) to complete the program, you\u2019ll be refunded $3600 at most, not your full expense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Relentless process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Serious job hunting is intense. But when you\u2019re doing it on your own terms, there may be fluctuations: you may take a break from sending job applications during Christmas week, for instance. OpenClassrooms\u2019 policy doesn\u2019t seem to entail this sort of flexibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pressure to accept<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you don\u2019t accept a \u201cvalid\u201d job offer, you won\u2019t be entitled to a refund. The policy seems to define as valid any offer relevant to what you studied and remunerated in line with the local market. But it encompasses both part-time and full-time positions. So if you\u2019re looking for full-time work, but get offered a part-time position and reject it, you may lose your refund.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, I\u2019m being finicky. Perhaps OpenClassrooms will follow the spirit of the policy rather than the letter. And they may not follow-up with the employers mentioned in your reports, meaning that even if you were to reject a \u201cvalid\u201d offer, they wouldn&#8217;t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you won\u2019t know for sure until you send your refund request, 6 months after an intense job search that, by then, would have involved at least 240 job applications. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t risk it. I\u2019d treat the job search like a full-time job, trying to closely stick to the policy to preempt any potential refund refusal.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find OpenClassrooms\u2019 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openclassrooms.com\/en\/terms-of-sale#hired-or-refunded\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">job guarantee policy here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

But as far as I can tell, these differ only in small ways. For instance, Springboard\u2019s Data Analyst certificate requires two years of professional experience, while their Tech Sales certificate requires only one year for the policy to apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are all the <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.springboard.com\/job-guarantee\/\">job guarantee policies of Springboard<\/a>\u2019s programs:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX Design Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech Sales Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Science Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UI\/UX Design Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Analytics Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyber Security Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software Engineering Career Track<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the terms of these policies are largely the same, in the remainder of this article, I&#8217;ll discuss them as if they were one single policy. Springboard&#8217;s job guarantee can be summarized as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_82215\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82215\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/springboard-job-guarantee.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-82215 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/springboard-job-guarantee.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"895\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/springboard-job-guarantee.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/springboard-job-guarantee-300x262.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/springboard-job-guarantee-768x671.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-82215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.springboard.com\/job-guarantee\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Springboard job guarantee<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> summary table<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, Springboard\u2019s job guarantee policy follows the usual pattern: a study phase followed by a job application phase, leading to a refund if you can\u2019t get a job. That said, the policy also comes with its own quirks. Here are some of the aspects of the policy that caught my eye:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not Global<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The policy doesn\u2019t apply worldwide. On the contrary, it\u2019s very localized. First, it\u2019s limited to two countries: the US and Canada. Second, it\u2019s limited to specific cities within those two countries.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working remotely is accepted, but even then, you\u2019re asked to apply to positions tied to a specific list of metropolitan areas. So if you\u2019d like to work locally but don\u2019t live in one of the US top-20 or Canada\u2019s top-5 largest cities, you likely won\u2019t be eligible for the job guarantee policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Degree &amp; Experience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: To benefit from the policy, learners should have a bachelor\u2019s degree, professional experience, and sometimes both. This is a significant requirement, seemingly designed to ensure learners possess the ability to succeed in an academic program and in the workforce, and are therefore prepared for Springboard\u2019s career programs and job hunt.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the requirement is also strict, severely reducing who can benefit from the job guarantee policy. If you have a degree, but want to switch careers via Springboard, you\u2019re eligible. But if you don\u2019t have prior studies and would like to use the program to jumpstart a career in tech, you can enroll in Springboard&#8217;s programs, but you won\u2019t be eligible for their job guarantee. Unfortunately, those who could use the policy the most are precisely those who are left out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Study Conditions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Springboard\u2019s job guarantee policy includes conditions related to the study period. In short, the policy is contingent on the learner finishing the certificate program within 6 months \u2014 that is, you\u2019re not allowed to fall behind, otherwise you might lose the job guarantee even before your job search begins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Low Pays Count<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: To get refunded the cost of the program, you shouldn\u2019t refuse a \u201cvalid\u201d job offer. Springboard is rather explicit regarding what they consider valid: the offer should entail full-time or near-full-time salaried or freelance work. So if you were to apply for a full-time position, but the employer offered you a part-time one, you could refuse it and still be eligible for a refund. Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when it comes to pay, Springboard doesn\u2019t mention a baseline for what it considers fair. So what happens if an employer lowballs you? They get back to you with a job offer that pays less than advertised in the job posting. If you reject the offer, could you lose your potential refund?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re paying for the program using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.springboard.com\/how-it-works\/payment-options\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deferred tuition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the policy actually lists figures regarding what it considers sufficient pay (say, $50K a year). But if you\u2019re paying for the program upfront or monthly (like most people, I imagine), there are no numbers mentioned. As a result, learners might feel pressured to accept the first offer they get, since they\u2019d lose their refund anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, if you\u2019re considering Springboard\u2019s programs because of their job guarantee policies, make sure to read the terms in full.
