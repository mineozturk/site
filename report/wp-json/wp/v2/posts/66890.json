The total number of MOOCs available to register for at any point of time is larger than ever, thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-trends-increased-flexibility-and-convenience\/\">tweaks in the scheduling policy<\/a> by MOOC providers.<\/p>\n<p>However, for the first time we are seeing a slowdown in the number of new learners, which is a direct result of a shift in priorities towards <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2016-12-29-monetization-over-massiveness-breaking-down-moocs-by-the-numbers-in-2016\">users who are willing to pay<\/a>. According to data gathered by <strong>Class Central<\/strong>, around 23 million new learners signed up for their first MOOC in 2017. That&#8217;s similar than the 23 million new learners who registered for a MOOC in 2016. The total number of MOOC learners is now 81 million.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a list of the top five MOOC providers by registered users:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coursera \u2014 30 million users.<\/li>\n<li>edX \u2014 14 million users.<\/li>\n<li>XuetangX \u2014 9.3 million users.<\/li>\n<li>Udacity \u2014 8 million users.<\/li>\n<li>FutureLearn \u2014 7.1 million users.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Though growth in new learners has stalled, the number of paying users has increased. Coursera saw paying users increase by 70% this year. Meanwhile, Udacity has more than 50,000 paying students enrolled in its Nanodegree programs.<\/p>\n<p>As the MOOC platforms continue their quest for sustainable revenue models, MOOC providers have begun charging not just for certificates and other credentials, but for access to content. The big MOOC providers now have a product at every price point \u2014 from free to millions of dollars. Efforts over the years in online degree programs and corporate training products are showing results. The total potential revenue just from students currently enrolled in these online degree programs offered on the major MOOC platforms now exceeds $65 million.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66807\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-growth.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-growth.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-growth-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-growth-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The pace at which new courses are being added has increased slightly (this might also be attributed to shorter courses being offered as part of a sequence). To date, over 800 universities around the world have launched at least one MOOC. The number of announced MOOCs stands at 9,400, up from 6,850 last year.<\/p>\n<p>Keep reading <strong>Class Central<\/strong>\u2019s comprehensive analysis to learn more about MOOCs in 2017.<\/p>\n<h2>Top 2017 Trends<\/h2>\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/six-tiers-mooc-monetization\/\">A product at every price point<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66845\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-six-tiers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-six-tiers.png 1025w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-six-tiers-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-six-tiers-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-six-tiers-1024x512.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><br \/>\nOriginally, all MOOCs were offered as free courses. While content varied greatly from course to course, MOOC providers essentially offered a single product: university courses packaged for online audiences and offered free of charge. The big MOOC providers have now developed products and services that range in price from free (or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-started-completely-free-now\/\">partially free<\/a>) to costing millions of dollars.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Central<\/strong> has identified six different tiers that MOOC providers monetize on: free (or free to audit), certificate, micro-credential, university credit, online degrees, and corporate training. Each tier of pricing adds some value on the tiers below it. Essentially, the same product (the one that anyone can register for, free of charge) is being monetized at different pricing levels, with the free product acting as a marketing channel that feeds customers into other higher priced products.<\/p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-trends-content-paywalls\/\">Content Paywalls<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>When MOOCs first started out, they were all completely free. Their free-ness, in fact, was what distinguished MOOCs from other kinds of online courses. However, as the MOOC platforms search for sustainable business models, we have increasingly seen content placed behind paywalls. 2017 saw a continuation of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocwatch-april-2017-shrinking-free\/\">shrinking of free<\/a>, as we have discussed in a previous analysis. MOOCs now exist along a spectrum, with fully-free courses at one end (yes, they do still exist) and completely-paid online courses at the other end.<\/p>\n<p>Coursera has put <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-paywall-edx-discontinues-free-certificates\/\">graded assignments<\/a> behind paywalls, FutureLearn has developed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/futurelearn-new-pricing-model\/\">time-based paywall<\/a>, and Udacity (after proclaiming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2017-10-12-udacity-official-declares-moocs-dead-though-the-company-still-offers-them\">MOOCs are dead<\/a>) seems to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-2017-review\/\">given up<\/a> on the whole concept of free and is aggressively moving towards monetizing content.\u00a0Though edX hosts paid-only courses, it remains the only platform that still offers most of its courses for free (minus the free certificate).<\/p>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-find-audience-professional-learners-universities\/\">MOOCs find their audience: Professional Learners<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66045\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/moocwatch-15.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/moocwatch-15.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/moocwatch-15-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/moocwatch-15-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The narrative in the early days of the MOOC space was around the disruption to universities. Six years later, we know that MOOCs are not going to lead to the demise of universities. However, according to the previous CEO of Coursera, Rick Levin, while MOOCs may not have disrupted the higher education market, they are disrupting the labor market. The real audience for these courses is not the traditional university student but what Levin calls the \u201clifelong career learner\u201d: someone who might be well beyond their college years, but takes online courses with the goal of achieving professional and career growth.<\/p>\n<h2>4. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-trends-online-degrees-corporate-learning\/\">Online Degrees and Corporate Training<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The MOOC platforms\u2019 entry into the markets for online degrees and corporate learning isn\u2019t a new trend. However, this year saw a few new developments, and even a few milestones achieved. Quite simply, online degrees and corporate training are existing markets worth billions of dollars, and MOOC providers want a slice of that.<\/p>\n<p>Several new MOOC-based online degrees (or plans to launch online degrees) were announced in 2017. More than 7,000 students are enrolled in these online degrees and the total potential revenue exceeds $65 million.<\/p>\n<p>On the corporate training side, Coursera ended 2017 with more than 500 companies signed up for its Coursera for Business service, up from 30 last year. EdX for Business is now working with 40 companies.<\/p>\n<h2>5. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-trends-increased-flexibility-and-convenience\/\">Increased Flexibility and Convenience<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>As for the past several years, MOOC providers have continued to make their product more flexible and convenient. Scheduling tweaks have made it possible for many MOOCs to be made available throughout the year so that learners can start them immediately.<\/p>\n<h2>6. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mit-georgia-tech-moocs-show-up-on-campus\/\">MOOCs Are Showing Up On Campus<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Up to now, efforts to offer university credit for MOOCs have been targeted towards students who are enrolled in on-campus degree programs at the universities that produced the MOOCs in question. Now, for the first time, we are seeing examples in which on-campus students have the option to earn credit from MOOCs\u00a0\u2014 even from universities other than the one they attend.<\/p>\n<p>In the U.S., for a certain course at Georgia Tech and MIT, students were given a choice: enroll in the traditional on-campus course, or sign up for a parallel version of the class that would be completely online. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, TU Delft ran a pilot to let their students earn credit from MOOCs offered on edX by other universities, via a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.e-learn.nl\/2017\/12\/23\/virtual-exchange-programme\">Virtual Exchange program<\/a>. At the end of 2017, TU Delft signed an agreement with eight other universities. Now, students from this entire group of universities can earn credit for each others\u2019 MOOCs. The universities participating in this program are: the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Wageningen University and Research, Rice University, the University of Queensland, the Australian National University, the University of Adelaide, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Leiden University.<\/p>\n<h2>Credentials<\/h2>\n<p>More than 500 MOOC-based credentials are now available. Coursera\u2019s Specializations lead the pack with over 250 credentials. It&#8217;s followed by edX, which has around 170 credentials split across 4 types: MicroMasters, XSeries, Professional Certificate, and Professional Education. XuetangX also launched eight \u201cmicro degrees.\u201d Many (if not the majority) of the new courses that were launched in 2017 are part of credentials. A few of the longer courses originally launched in 2012 and 2013 have also been split up into multiple courses and re-launched under a credential.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66806\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screenshot-2018-1-12-MOOC-based-credentials.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screenshot-2018-1-12-MOOC-based-credentials.png 1044w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screenshot-2018-1-12-MOOC-based-credentials-230x300.png 230w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screenshot-2018-1-12-MOOC-based-credentials-768x1000.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screenshot-2018-1-12-MOOC-based-credentials-786x1024.png 786w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1044px) 100vw, 1044px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Online Degrees<\/h2>\n<p>Online graduate degrees are a lucrative monetization opportunity for MOOC providers. Initial results from these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/pricing-charts\/mooc-based-degrees\">MOOC-based degree programs<\/a> have been good. The Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (Udacity and Georgia Tech) has around 6,000 students enrolled. The iMBA (Coursera and the University of Illinois) has over 800 enrolled students; meanwhile, the Online Masters in Analytics (edX and Georgia Tech), announced at the beginning of 2017, has 650 students enrolled. A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation tells us that the potential revenue to be earned from these three degrees is greater than $65 million, based on the current number of enrolled students.<\/p>\n<p>Coursera plans to launch 15\u201320 degrees by 2019, while FutureLearn has announced that they will launch 50 degrees in partnership with Coventry University. XuetangX also announced three online Master\u2019s degrees with Zhengzhou University.<\/p>\n<h2>Subjects<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66811\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-subjects.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-subjects.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-subjects-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-subjects-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Overall, the distribution of courses across subjects has remained quite similar to last year, with the exception of Technology courses (Computer Science, Programming, and Data Science). This category grew by two and a half percent. Business and Technology courses make up almost 40% of all courses. Not surprisingly, these are the categories of courses that have been easiest for MOOC providers to monetize. The target audience for these courses is a group that former CEO of Coursera Rick Levin has called\u00a0 \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-find-audience-professional-learners-universities\/\">professional lifelong learners<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Providers<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66808\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-providers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-providers.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-providers-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/2017-roundup-providers-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Coursera is still the largest MOOC provider in the world with over 2,700 active courses.
