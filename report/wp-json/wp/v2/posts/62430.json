In fact, more people signed up for MOOCs in 2015 than they did in the first three years of the \u201cmodern\u201d MOOC movement (which started in late 2011\u2014when the first Stanford MOOCs took off). According to data collected by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Class Central<\/a>, the total number of students who signed up for at least one course has crossed 35 million\u2014up from an estimated 17 million <a title=\"Online Courses Raise Their Game: A Review of MOOC Stats and Trends in 2014\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-stats-and-trends-2014\/\">last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, Coursera claimed more student signups than Udacity, edX and all other MOOC providers combined. This year, Coursera accounted for slightly less than half of all MOOC students. One company to watch is FutureLearn, a UK-based company owned by The Open University, which grew its user base from 800,000 students in 2014 to nearly three million students this year\u2014more than Udacity.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, 1,800 new courses were announced, taking the total number of courses to 4,200 from over 550 universities.<\/p>\n<div><a style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" title=\"Number of Courses vs time\" href=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/88\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%; width: 1569px;\" src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/88.png\" alt=\"Number of Courses vs time\" width=\"1569\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<h2>Subjects<\/h2>\n<p>With a distinct focus on monetization in 2015, many MOOC providers and partner universities offered more courses covering in-demand skills in technology and business fields. The percentage of Computer Science and Programming courses grew more than 10 percent. This growth in technical and business courses has correlated with a decrease in the humanities and social science courses, but overall there is still a healthy balance of technical and non-technical courses.<\/p>\n<div><a style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" title=\"Course Distribution by Subjects\" href=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/77\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%; width: 1569px;\" src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/~dhawalhs\/77.png\" alt=\"Course Distribution by Subjects\" width=\"1569\" \/><\/a><script src=\"https:\/\/plot.ly\/embed.js\" async=\"\" data-plotly=\"dhawalhs:77\"><\/script><\/div>\n<h2>Providers<\/h2>\n<p>Not much has changed in course distribution among providers.

For Coursera and Udacity, these credentials have become a main source of revenue, and both companies have raised big venture rounds to create more. Currently there are more than 100 credentials available from MOOC providers.<\/p>\n<p>EdX, on the other hand is focusing on creating ways for students to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2015-11-23-edx-buckles-down-to-offer-credit-for-moocs\">earn credit with MOOCs<\/a>. Earlier this year in April, the nonprofit partnered with Arizona State University to create the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-credit-asu-edx-global-freshman-academy\/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Freshman Academy<\/a>. It is also pursuing partnerships with credit-granting institutions that students can earn credits through schools including the American Council on Education, Charter Oak State College and MIT.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/death-of-free-certificates\/\" target=\"_blank\">Death of free certificates<\/a>:<\/strong> The pursuit of revenues has meant that many MOOC providers have stopped offering free certificates. The average course of a Coursera certificate is $56; for edX, $53. Coursera is going one step further and is introducing a paywall for graded assignments for some courses.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/h\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rise of self-paced courses<\/a>:<\/strong> MOOCs started out with a structure parallel to college classroom courses, with a start and end date, and specific deadlines for assignments. One issue with these courses is that students would not know when\u2014or if\u2014the class would be offered again. Currently, 55% of all courses listed on Class Central do not have an upcoming start date.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, MOOC providers have moved towards a self-paced model, meaning that courses are always open to signup and users can complete a course at their own pace. There are now <a href=\"http:\/\/h\/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 800 self-paced courses<\/a> (20% of all MOOCs on Class Central), and the number is growing quickly. Coursera also introduced regularly scheduled sessions with soft deadlines. These sessions usually run once a month. If a student is not able to finish the course, they can always move to the next session without losing their place in the course.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/high-school-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\">Targeting high school<\/a>:<\/strong> MOOC providers have started targeting high schoolers with the intentions of closing the college readiness gap, helping students to get a taste of different majors through introductory courses, and providing exam preparation (like AP) courses.Two specific MOOC providers are leading the charge: edX with its High School Initiative, and FutureLearn with the Going to University Collection.<\/p>\n<h2>2015: Less Experimentation, More Iteration<\/h2>\n<p>If the first generation of MOOCs was simply a catalog of free courses, today\u2019s MOOCs are created with more intentionality and, for learners, practical outcomes. The concept behind online courses still remains the same, but the packaging has evolved. That the \u201cBig Three\u201d MOOC providers are now focused on making credentials matter\u2014whether through Nanodegrees, Specializations or course credits\u2014signals a maturation in offering a clearer value proposition. (From the company\u2019s perspective, it also helps that credentials have now become the business model that so many have asked about.)<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, we can expect to see a lot more credentials and credits. But as MOOC providers try to aggressively monetize, early adopters may find that critical components of the learning experience will no longer be free.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article is just one in our 2015 MOOC Roundup Series. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/tag\/mooc-roundup-2015\/\">Find the whole series of articles here<\/a>, and discover everything MOOCs in 2015 \u2014 from the most popular classes, to overviews on developments in MOOC platforms, to looking at the MOOC-future.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have massive open online courses emerged from the Trough of Disillusionment to the Slopes of Enlightenment?
