After a lackluster 2018 \u2014 plagued by underwhelming growth, a decrease in paid enrollments, and a lack of blockbuster Nanodegrees \u2014 Udacity needed to react strongly to steady the ship.<\/p>\n<p>The reaction began in late 2018 with the return of Sebastian Thrun to the helm of the company following the departure of Vishal Makhijani. Thrun\u2019s return marked the beginning of a drastic restructuring plan designed to put Udacity back on track to profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity updates its tagline almost every year. In 2019, they went back to their 2016 tagline: \u201cBe in demand.\u201d But if we had to condense Udacity\u2019s 2019 in a single sentence, we\u2019d go with \u201cDoing more with less.\u201d To understand why, keep reading.

But in May 2019, Udacity switched to a subscription model: you pay $399 per month to access a Nanodegree.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity framed the change as a positive, allowing learners to save money by finishing their Nanodegrees more rapidly. However, by Udacity\u2019s own account, most Nanodegrees take between three and four months to complete. This translates into an effective cost of between $1,200 and $1,600 per Nanodegree \u2014 about twice what they used to cost in early 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity has continued to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-pricing-tweaks\/\">tweak its pricing model<\/a>. As of October 2019, instead of paying $399 for one-month access, learners may pay upfront for several months and get a discount. So Udacity replaced flat fees with subscriptions, only to bring flat fees back six months later.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69880\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69880\" style=\"width: 896px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/data-eng-nd.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69880\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/data-eng-nd.png\" alt=\"Data Engineer Nanodegree Cost\" width=\"896\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/data-eng-nd.png 896w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/data-eng-nd-300x245.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/data-eng-nd-768x628.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-69880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Data Engineer Nanodegree Cost<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The 2019 price increase is compounded by the fact that in 2018, prices had already doubled or even tripled.

Some learners report seeing different prices depending on which computer they\u2019re using, and on whether they\u2019re logged into Udacity or not:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why do <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/udacity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@udacity<\/a> show me a totally different price for the same nanodegree based on if I am logged in or not? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/fHJmNAvwcC\">pic.twitter.com\/fHJmNAvwcC<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Daryl Cole (@mkupsmth) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mkupsmth\/status\/1203847239531028480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>These price hikes and experiments denote urgency and suggest financial struggle. Udacity hasn\u2019t raised funds since 2015, and in early 2019, Thrun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/under-thrun-udacity-revamps-its-strategy\/\">stated<\/a> that the company\u2019s \u201ctrajectory was not long-term tenable.\u201d 2020 is probably going to be a pivotal year for Udacity.<\/p>\n<h3>Nanodegrees<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Udacity launched more Nanodegrees than ever before, but they also retired a few.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-2018-review\/\">last year\u2019s analysis<\/a>, Dhawal Shah, Class Central\u2019s CEO, noted that none of Udacity\u2019s 2018 Nanodegrees were big hits. Thrun would later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/under-thrun-udacity-revamps-its-strategy\/\">echo this sentiment<\/a>, partly attributing the company\u2019s bad spell to a lack of blockbusters.<\/p>\n<p>To address this issue, Udacity changed its approach to Nanodegree creation. Nanodegrees are now developed by smaller, leaner content-creation teams capable of producing Nanodegrees more quickly and at a fraction of their previous cost.<\/p>\n<p>This new approach has allowed Udacity to speed up Nanodegrees rollout. Udacity released 14 new Nanodegrees in 2019 (5 more than in 2018):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>C++ Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Data Engineer Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Marketing Analytics Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Data Engineering Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Data Visualization Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>AI Product manager Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Cloud Developer Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Cloud DevOps Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Java Developer Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>UX Designer Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Data Streaming Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Intel Edge for AI Nanodegree<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, they updated some of their bestsellers, including the Front-End, Full-Stack, and Machine Learning Nanodegrees. But they also retired a few programs, including their Virtual Reality Nanodegrees. And they cancelled or postponed others, such as their Cybersecurity Nanodegree.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity currently offers 40 Nanodegrees.<\/p>\n<h3>Mentors<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Udacity hired new Mentors and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-1-on-1-mentorships\/\">expanded their role<\/a>, but not their pay.<\/p>\n<p>While they were laying off several hundred full-time employees on the one hand, they were recruiting several thousand part-time Mentors on the other. Mentors support learners during their Nanodegree. They used to do this collectively, via community chat rooms. But since mid-2019, Mentors also offer one-on-one support, in a bid to increase graduation rates.<\/p>\n<p>But the new mentorship model arrives in the wake of pay cuts to Udacity Mentors, which seems to reflect the overarching theme of Udacity\u2019s 2019: doing more with less. Indeed, in 2019, Udacity:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded student support while lowering Mentors\u2019 pay.<\/li>\n<li>Accelerated Nanodegrees rollout while laying off content creators.<\/li>\n<li>Increased Nanodegree prices while spending less money producing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These forces seemingly pulling in opposite directions raise an important question:<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>Can Udacity cut costs and employees while maintaining quality and learner satisfaction?<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Other<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Udacity showed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-lays-off-20-of-staff-continues-transformation\/\">other symptoms<\/a> of going through a dry spell:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cancelling Intersect<\/strong>: Udacity didn\u2019t organize its annual conference, Intersect \u2014 a first since the conference was inaugurated in 2016.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sunsetting app<\/strong>: Udacity retired its official mobile app from the App Store and Google Play.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Closing offices<\/strong>: Udacity closed or downsized several of its offices worldwide, including its S\u00e3o Paulo office, in Brazil.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Results<\/h2>\n<p>Thrun only retook the reins of Udacity on an interim basis. His restructuring plan was implemented as a short-term response to the company\u2019s downturn. To carry the company in the long run, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/gabriel-dalporto-becomes-udacitys-new-ceo\/\">Gabriel Dalporto was appointed CEO<\/a> of Udacity in August 2019.<\/p>\n<h3>New CEO<\/h3>\n<p>Dalporto joined Udacity after an eight-year stint at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace where he served in various leadership positions. Now head of Udacity, his role is to formulate and orchestrate the company\u2019s long-term strategy.<\/p>\n<p>So far, this strategy has remained largely unchanged, with Dalporto emphasizing efficient Nanodegrees rollout through cost-effective production and price-conscious decisions. However, he\u2019s also considering new strategies, such as partnering with universities and expanding the enterprise business \u2014 for instance, in India, where Udacity just doubled its staff.<\/p>\n<h3>Top Nanodegrees<\/h3>\n<p>According to Udacity, the company\u2019s most popular Nanodegrees in 2019 were the:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data Engineering Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Machine Learning Nanodegree<\/li>\n<li>Intro to Programming Nanodegree<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Interestingly, the ranking is topped by one of Udacity\u2019s newer Nanodegrees. And the second Nanodegree was updated this year. This confirms that novelty is key to attract new learners. However, the third Nanodegree is one of Udacity\u2019s oldest, which illustrates why Udacity is so keen on finding its next big hit: a Nanodegree that will continue to perform well long after its novelty has faded.<\/p>\n<h3>Free Courses<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Udacity launched 7 free courses, down from 35 in 2018. This drastic drop emphasizes Udacity\u2019s focus on paid content, and it further distances the company from its roots as one of the world\u2019s major open course providers.<\/p>\n<table>\n<caption style=\"caption-side: bottom;\">Udacity New Free Courses<\/caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2013<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2014<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2015<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2016<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2017<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2018<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>2019<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12<\/td>\n<td>31<\/td>\n<td>64<\/td>\n<td>49<\/td>\n<td>34<\/td>\n<td>35<\/td>\n<td>7<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Graduations<\/h3>\n<p>In an email to Class Central, Udacity states having reached 100 thousand Nanodegree graduates in 2019, up from 65 thousand in 2018. Although encouraging, this metric has to be considered in light of others such as revenue, which Udacity plans to share in early 2020.<\/p>\n<h3>Scholarships<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Udacity announced four <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/scholarships\">scholarship programs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Scholarships give learners a chance to earn a free spot in a Nanodegree. Each scholarship focuses on a different subject, is sponsored by a different industry partner, and may lead to a different Nanodegree.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scholarship<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Partner<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Nanodegrees Funded<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Science<\/td>\n<td>Bertelsmann<\/td>\n<td>1,600<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Secure &amp; Private AI<\/td>\n<td>Facebook<\/td>\n<td>300<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DeepRacer<\/td>\n<td>Amazon Web Services<\/td>\n<td>200<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edge AI<\/td>\n<td>Intel<\/td>\n<td>750<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>This article is just one of our 2019 MOOC Roundup Series.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/tag\/mooc-roundup-2019\/\">Find the whole series here<\/a>.
