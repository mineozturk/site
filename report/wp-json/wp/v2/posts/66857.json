Later, she went to say that \u201cfree content is still available\u201d on Udacity\u2019s platform.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed free content is still available, but it seems to be a legacy feature. Udacity is pivoting away from free and is starting to resemble an online part-time bootcamp provider.\u00a0 Udacity is moving aggressively towards monetizing content via a strict deadline policy. More on this below.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity\u2019s strategy has been to launch high profile projects and get a lot of press attention. In 2017, they continued this approach and announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-flying-car-nanodegrees\/\">Flying Car Nanodegree<\/a> with MIT faculty. This was based on the success of its Self-Driving Car Nanodegree which got a lot of press and has over 10,000 enrolled students. The self-driving car Nanodegree also led to a Udacity engineer involved with the Nanodegree to launch a self-driving car company.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-nanodegree-upfront-payment\/\">Udacity Shifts Towards Upfront Payment Without Job Guarantee<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-blitz-shutdown\/\">Udacity&#8217;s Blitz.com, A Freelancing Platform for Nanodegree Alumni, Shuts Down<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p>But not all of Udacity\u2019s high profile projects from 2016 which received a lot of media attention have survived.

I also wrote about how Udacity was moving away from both its job guarantee and its half your money back guarantee. That move is now complete, and these programs have disappeared from Udacity.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Udacity truly went global, launching country-specific initiatives. Its career pages show a stunning 140 open jobs in 10 different countries. According to Udacity\u2019s profile in LinkedIn Top Companies: Startups, the company currently has around 500 employees.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity had a really busy year and there\u00a0is a\u00a0lot to unpack here.

In September, Udacity released some stats about their Nanodegrees. Overall, 53,000 students are currently enrolled in Nanodegrees, which is a 4x increase from last year. (This number does not include students who received scholarships or students from Udacity\u2019s enterprise efforts.) There are now over 18,000 Nanodegree graduates. Udacity is also on track to double revenues.<\/p>\n<p>The Self-Driving Car Nanodegree has 10,000 students enrolled and it received 43,000 applications. The first cohort has not yet graduated, but according to Udacity 60 students have already found jobs in the field.<\/p>\n<h2>The End of Free at Udacity?<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66863\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Content-FAQ.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Content-FAQ.png 1780w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Content-FAQ-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Content-FAQ-768x205.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Content-FAQ-1024x274.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1780px) 100vw, 1780px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Udacity has a good catalog of free courses. However, they appear to have given up on the concept of free and moved aggressively to monetize content. The number of free online courses launched by Udacity has been decreasing since 2015. Udacity\u2019s newer Nanodegree programs no longer include any free courses. Of those free courses that Udacity launched in 2017, most of them were trivial (one or two weeks long) and didn\u2019t have substantial content. (The one exception I would offer to this would be the few courses that were launched by Georgia Tech. These courses are part of their Online Masters of Science in Computer Science degree.)<\/p>\n<p>Even for paid Nanodegree students, access to the content is for a limited time only. For example, in the\u00a0 Machine Learning Nanodegree, you have six months plus a free four week extension to complete the program. But if you don\u2019t, you need sign up for another term and pay the full price. These terms also start on a fixed date. This begs an important question about the value of Nanodegree credential. Is the real value the content or the Nanodegree itself? If the answer is the latter, then why does Udacity need to so aggressively limit access to content?<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66854\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Digital-Marketing-Payment.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Digital-Marketing-Payment.jpg 1980w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Digital-Marketing-Payment-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Digital-Marketing-Payment-768x486.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Digital-Marketing-Payment-1024x647.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1980px) 100vw, 1980px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For some Nanodegrees, for example, the Digital Marketing Nanodegree, Udacity has started charging solely for content by offering a cheaper price just to access the content. The Digital Marketing Nanodegree usually costs $999, but for $599 you can get access to the learning materials without the Nanodegree credential.<\/p>\n<h2>Nanodegrees<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66865\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Page-Jan-2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Page-Jan-2018.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Page-Jan-2018-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Page-Jan-2018-768x434.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Udacity-Nanodegree-Page-Jan-2018-1024x579.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing this article, Udacity has 22 active Nanodegrees available. This doesn\u2019t include the Flying Car Nanodegree which has been announced and not been launched.\u00a0 There also have been some Nanodegrees that Udacity has launched and shut down, such as the Ruby Developer Nanodegree.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Udacity announced 9 new Nanodegrees: Robotics, Flying-car, Intro to Self-Driving Car, Digital Marketing, React JS, Data Foundations, Design Sprint Foundations, Google Adwords,\u00a0 and Learn ArKIT. Some of the older Nanodegrees also saw a refresh in content and pricing.<\/p>\n<p>For a couple of Nanodegrees, such as\u00a0 Deep Learning Foundation and React JS, Udacity partnered with popular content creators. The Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree, in particular, was originally launched as Siraj Raval\u2019s Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree. Siraj Raval is a popular Youtuber who teaches Artificial Intelligence. He gets over a 1 million views per month on his Youtube channel. Though Siraj Raval is still listed as one of the instructors on the Nanodegree, his branding has been removed from it and is no longer featured as a part of the Nanodegree.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a list of all Udacity Nanodegrees and their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/pricing-charts\/udacity-nanodegrees\">prices<\/a>.

Some Nanodegrees, such as the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, are divided into three different terms of three months. A few older Nanodegrees run on a monthly subscription basis can be started immediately. You can find them in the list above.<\/p>\n<p>The term based scheduling also means that that students need to finish all projects before the end of the term. Those who fail to do so are offered a 4-week extension to complete any outstanding projects. If they don\u2019t, they are kicked out the program and lose access to the content. Students also don\u2019t have an option to pause their Nanodegrees. They rejoin the Nanodegree the next term, but will have to pay the full price again. Even those who successfully complete a Nanodegree, will have their access removed after a period of time after graduation.<\/p>\n<p>Via these changes, Udacity has created a rigid structure that seems closer to a university\u2019s semester pattern. Interestingly,\u00a0 Silicon Valley University is starting to look a lot like a traditional university.<\/p>\n<h2>Shutdowns and Closures<\/h2>\n<h2>Blitz.com<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66531\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Udacity-Blitz.com-Homepage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Udacity-Blitz.com-Homepage.png 1600w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Udacity-Blitz.com-Homepage-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Udacity-Blitz.com-Homepage-768x411.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Udacity-Blitz.com-Homepage-1024x548.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A year ago Udacity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacitys-blitz\/\">announced<\/a> Blitz.com, a freelancing platform for Nanodegree alumni, with great fanfare.

Udacity would only take a cut of 5\u201310% of the project fee. Projects could range from $5,000 to upwards of $50,000.<\/p>\n<p>According to Udacity, their graduates have earned around $1.5M through Blitz. Some Udacity Blitz contributors (we don\u2019t know how many) have been hired by their client companies, as well as Udacity\u2019s own engineering team.<\/p>\n<p>But in November 2017 Udacity announced that Blitz will be \u201cwinding down,\u201d and will not take any new projects.

If you followed him on Twitter, you could constantly see him talking about self driving cars.<\/p>\n<p>Voyage so far has raised $20M and is now rolling out a self-driving taxi service to over 125,000 residents at a private city in Florida. Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Udacity, is himself CEO of KittyHawk, a flying car company.<\/p>\n<h2>Udacity Connect<\/h2>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8Ki9zqRscN0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Udacity Connect is basically a face-to-face version of Udacity Nanodegrees. Originally, Udacity Connect was a $99\/month add-on to Nanodegrees. Nanodegree students in some areas could visit physical locations in their neighborhood each week to work with peers and get face-to-face guidance for setting goals and hitting key milestones.<\/p>\n<p>Then Udacity launched Connect Intensive in late 2016, which was similar to Udacity Connect, but with a fixed and rigorous schedule. The tagline of the program is \u201cBootcamp-level intensity. Without quitting your day job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The original Udacity Connect is no longer available and Udacity Connect Intensive has been rebranded as Udacity Connect. Currently, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/uconnect\">Udacity Connect<\/a> page, it costs $2,500 per Nanodegree and is available only in California. But in 2017, Udacity announced that this features would be available in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-connect-blended-learning-expansion\/\">14 different cities in 9 countries<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Terminal.com Acquisition<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65351\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Terminal.com-Homepage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Terminal.com-Homepage.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Terminal.com-Homepage-300x162.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Terminal.com-Homepage-768x414.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Terminal.com-Homepage-1024x552.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Udacity made its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-acquires-terminal-com\/\">first acquisition<\/a>, ClouldLabs, maker of Terminal.com. Terminal.com originally started out as a mix of Cloud9 (in-browser IDE) and Heroku (platform as a service). You can see a demo of an early version of its platform on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BukjPONmO1w\">YouTube<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It seems that Udacity has already sold the domain, but the team behind Terminal.com is helping integrate the technology into Udacity. Here is what one of the Terminal.com engineers has mentioned on his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/willkessler\/\">LinkedIn profile<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIn September 2017 we launched several IDE&#8217;s for students to work on their projects in the cloud: a coding IDE, a Jupyter Notebook IDE, and a SQL IDE, all based on Cloudlabs technology. These are helping students learn in advanced courses like Data Analysis, AI, Robotics, and React.
