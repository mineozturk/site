It would be an expensive hobby to pay for all those certificates.<\/p>\n<p>Most FutureLearn courses can be explored for free for a limited time, but you need to pay if you want ongoing access and\/or a certificate. In March 2019, FutureLearn introduced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/futurelearn-unlimited\/\">12-month single price subscription<\/a> that allows you to earn certificates for most courses on the platform. You also keep ongoing access to any courses that you complete during the 12-month period.<\/p>\n<p>You might wonder why anyone would need ongoing access to a course. As a <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelearningsuccess.org\/\">site owner<\/a>, I need to be aware of legal issues such as GDPR. Instead of the daunting task of reading the whole GDPR document, I took two courses:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/gdpr-10758\">Introduction to GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/general-data-protection-regulation-9403\">Understanding the GDPR<\/a>, which discuss relevant clauses.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, free access to FutureLearn courses expires after the length of the course plus two weeks. So, I only had access to the first course for five weeks, while I lost access to the other course after six weeks. When I later wanted to check something, I could no longer see the course materials. I opened the GDPR document and began wading through it. Boredom quickly set in as I struggled to find what I needed.<\/p>\n<p>I began to consider paying for the courses. But I was unwilling to outlay US$99 each for these short courses.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I was preparing a comparison of\u00a0Programming For Everybody (Getting Started with Python) on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/programming-course-comparison\/\">three different online platforms<\/a>. Which would mean US$69 for the certificate.<\/p>\n<p>US$267 for three courses! FutureLearn Unlimited began looking very attractive, especially when a discounted price was offered. On October 27, 2019 I paid around US$177 for one year of FutureLearn Unlimited.<\/p>\n<p>I had great plans of taking dozens of courses during my 12 months of access.<\/p>\n<h2>Reality<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-72999\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-08-Unlimited-FutureLearn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-08-Unlimited-FutureLearn.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-08-Unlimited-FutureLearn-300x167.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-08-Unlimited-FutureLearn-1024x568.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot_2020-11-08-Unlimited-FutureLearn-768x426.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As well as revising and completing the GDPR courses, I happily re-enrolled in current sessions of some other FutureLearn courses I had previously taken, so I could keep access and refer to them at any time. I also enrolled in several other interesting courses.<\/p>\n<p>I repeated the GDPR courses and two others to receive certificates and ongoing access. I earned my certificate in the Python course.<\/p>\n<p>Although I managed to complete two more courses, I began feeling overwhelmed whenever I looked at my crowded FutureLearn profile page. I have dealt with <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelearningsuccess.org\/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-mooc-obsession\/\">addiction to online courses<\/a> before, but this time I found myself less focused. Procrastination became normal as I checked emails and social media. After all, it was only February and I had until late October to finish the courses.<\/p>\n<p>Another unexpected consequence of joining courses in October or November, then not looking at them again until months later, was that when I finally revisited them, the discussion forums were inactive. I had not realized how much I look forward to functioning discussions to help retain my interest.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, I found myself dabbling in a bunch of courses without making significant progress in many.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-stats-pandemic\/\">cloud had appeared on the horizon<\/a>, which was to impact my online learning in unexpected ways.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The last 48 hours have been crazy.  <\/p>\n<p>More than a million learners have used <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/classcentral?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@classcentral<\/a> to find their next course. <\/p>\n<p>In one day we received more traffic than the entire month of February. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/e0kIVE1NO3\">pic.twitter.com\/e0kIVE1NO3<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Dhawal Shah (@dhawalhshah) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dhawalhshah\/status\/1240008257235607552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>When the US went into lockdown, my part-time role at Class Central dealing with Help emails became full-time overnight. The flood took several weeks to slow to comfortable levels, while my own learning took a back seat.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Coursera announced a raft of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-free-certificate-covid-19\/\">free certificates<\/a> for a limited time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/futurelearn-free-certificates\/\">Free upgrades<\/a> were also available on some FutureLearn courses and I became side-tracked by the allure of free offers. As the Help emails decreased, I managed to finish several courses, particularly as I rarely left the house.<\/p>\n<p>By the time September (and a reminder from FutureLearn that my Unlimited subscription would expire in less than two months) arrived, I had received five free Coursera certificates and free upgrades for six FutureLearn courses. But wait! Shouldn\u2019t I be focusing on getting full value from my FutureLearn Unlimited subscription? I fitted in three more FutureLearn courses before my subscription expired.<\/p>\n<h2>FutureLearn Unlimited: Is It worth It?<\/h2>\n<p>If you are considering a subscription, identify and plan which courses to take. Are certificates or ongoing access important for you?<\/p>\n<p>If free, limited access is not sufficient, how much does each course cost? Would Unlimited be a better option?<\/p>\n<p>The discounted price for FutureLearn Unlimited was good value for the three courses I wanted. The other seven courses I received Unlimited benefits for were a bonus, but in the grand scheme of things, I didn\u2019t really need Unlimited for them. I didn\u2019t renew my subscription. Maybe, in the future, if I need certificates or ongoing access to several courses, I will consider a subscription again, especially if a discount is offered.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FutureLearn Unlimited costs $279.99 for one year and provides unlimited access with certificates to hundreds of online courses.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":72,"featured_media":72996,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[638],"tags":[43],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.3 (Yoast SEO v18.5.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>FutureLearn Unlimited: Is it Worth it?
