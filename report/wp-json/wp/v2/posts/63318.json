You\u2019re finally going to learn to code, or there\u2019s a new design program you\u2019re going to master. Perhaps, like me (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@laurie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laurie<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), you\u2019ve got one more finance class to take before you\u2019ll feel fully finished with your<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nopaymba.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online business education<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But you keep putting it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps you manage to log into the course and get started, but halfway through the first video lecture you notice that a new email has arrived in your inbox or someone has PM\u2019ed you on Facebook. Before you know it, you\u2019ve been sucked into the vortex we call the internet, the video lecture is over, and you have no idea what the professor said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound familiar? We know it does. We have both taken many online courses and built careers from the experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pat<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has written many articles about learning on her website <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelearningsuccess.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online Learning Success<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and here, on Class Central, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/how-to-finish-your-course\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight Ways to Finish Your Course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

A while back, Laurie asked her community of learners to help compile a definitive list of all the tips, tricks, and hacks that they use to stay on task while studying online. Here is what they came up with. And, we have added a few extras from comments below the original version of this post and other recent sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Sections<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For your convenience, we\u2019ve broken down the list into different sections.

Taking a walk during study breaks is another popular technique.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Stand up or move away from the computer. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, if you don\u2019t need to simultaneously work on problem sets or answer quiz questions, it can help to move out of reach of your keyboard to avoid any lingering temptation to see what\u2019s going on in other browser tabs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"psy\"><b>Psychology tricks<\/b><\/h2>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Reward yourself for completing small tasks. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One completed lesson = one hilarious cat video.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Pay for the course certificate. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/help\/moocs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MOOC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> providers, people who pay for a course certificate are more than ten times as likely to finish the course.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Log your accomplishments. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you display your certificates on your LinkedIn profile or on an educational portfolio, or even in a private list, make sure you\u2019re tracking your success.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Announce your intentions publicly. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you register for a new course, post about it on Facebook, tweet it out on Twitter, and mention it to friends and colleagues.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Make your online course a reward for finishing less pleasant tasks. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than thinking of studying as yet another to-do on your list, use your coursework as a reward for completing a difficult or un-enjoyable task.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use the Just Start technique. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This simple technique says that if you simply take the first step, you are much more likely to continue. What is the easiest thing you can do to get started? Open the webpage, log in, or read through the syllabus. Or just open the first lecture and let it load. When you use the Just Start technique, you may be surprised to see that after you Just Start, it\u2019s easier to Just Keep Going.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Get dressed for work. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a way of getting your professional game face on and keeping you serious, focused, and on-task.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Give yourself small assignments. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the Just Start technique, when you break up the work into very small assignments, like watching a single video or completing a single quiz, you can easily finish a course with just a few minutes of work per day.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"social\"><b>Social learning hacks<\/b><\/h2>\n<ol start=\"23\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Become part of a study group.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a powerful and proven motivator. Find a study group in the course discussion forum or bring your own to the course.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Join a livestream study group.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you can\u2019t find a study group for your particular course, find a generic <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/a\/201910\/04\/WS5d96c2c2a310cf3e3556ec38.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online study group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>#StudyWithMe.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If the study time of online groups doesn\u2019t fit your schedule, a search for #StudyWithMe on Youtube will bring up hundreds of videos of learners studying that might just help you stay in the mood. You can study with the video playing, maybe on a different device from the one you\u2019re using for your course.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Get a tutor or mentor. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may take some searching to find a tutor. Some programs, particularly those that involve a certificate, offer mentorship as part of the course.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Find a study buddy. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet someone in the course discussion forum, or sign up for a course with a friend.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Get an accountability partner. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great technique for staying motivated. All you need is a friend or relative who is willing to check in with you once per week and listen while you list your goals for the coming week and your accomplishments over the previous week.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"expert\"><b>Expert tips<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tips were most frequently mentioned by the experienced learners that Laurie spoke with.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"29\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use the Pomodoro technique. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to the Just Start technique mentioned above, the Pomodoro technique teaches you to work in a series of 25-minute intervals by setting a timer and then actually stopping to take a break when it goes off. That way your coursework is more approachable, since you only have to put in the effort until the timer tells you to quit. Also, you are able to more fully integrate the knowledge by vacillating between the focused and the diffuse modes of thinking. This technique is covered at length in the extremely popular course <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/learning-how-to-learn-2161\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning How to Learn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is popular around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Listen to scientifically designed concentration music. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concentrate more deeply than with regular music by listening to tracks that have been specially designed to put your brain in a heightened state of focused awareness.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.focusatwill.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus@Will<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one such service.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Crank up the speed. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Course platforms like Coursera and edX allow you to set the playback speed. Multiple people recommended making the professor talk just fast enough that you have to pay close attention to keep up.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Take notes. <\/b>This was by far the most highly recommended way to stay on task. Type notes in a second window, draw them on a tablet, or keep a pencil and paper next to your device \u2014 because even in this new world of online learning, nothing beats old-fashioned note-taking.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you like online courses but find it hard to see them through to the end?
