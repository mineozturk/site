Naturally, to achieve even better results, you will need to learn some fundamentals of marketing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-creative-writing-courses\/\">creative writing<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-content-marketing-courses\/\">content writing<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-seo-courses\/\">SEO optimization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The professional copywriter can be a small business owner, an employee in a marketing agency or within a department, or a freelance writer. Recently, professionals in many areas are migrating to remote work and you can easily find job offerings for experienced copywriters to work from home. Some people will say this market is saturated, but experts will say you just need to find the right niche. No matter what your aim is with copywriting, this is a skill that anyone can take advantage of, as it\u2019s always preferable to convey your message engagingly.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the copywriting market is at an all-time high. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/freelance-jobs\/copywriting\/\">Upwork<\/a> has over 2K freelance job offerings with an average pay of $19-$45 per hour. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workana.com\/jobs?language=en&amp;query=copywriting\">Workana <\/a>has over 2K copywriting offerings and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/search\/?geoId=103644278&amp;keywords=copywriter&amp;location=Estados%20Unidos\">LinkedIn<\/a> has over 25K copywriting offerings in the USA alone.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous rankings. It involves a three-step process:<\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b>, I\u2019m part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\">Class Central<\/a>, the leading search engine for online courses. We have a database of more than 50K online courses and hundreds of thousands of crowdsourced reviews. So it seemed like the natural starting point.<\/p>\n<p>I started by leveraging the database to make a preliminary selection of Copywriting courses, looking at things like ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks. So this was a purely data-driven step, relying on hard metrics to create an initial ranking that we could then iterate upon and expand.<\/p>\n<p>Using this approach, some of the top picks rapidly became apparent, since the best courses tend to have rave reviews. But I didn\u2019t stop there. Ratings and reviews rarely tell the whole story. So the next step was to bring my personal knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b>, I used my experience as an online learner to evaluate each of the preliminary picks.<\/p>\n<p>The first copywriting workshop I took part in was in 2018 on a 3-day in-person digital marketing bootcamp for digital products. We had an entire day dedicated to writing copy focused on email marketing and since then, I\u2019ve been addicted to writing clickbait-ish content. It\u2019s hard to avoid it once you know how effective it can be.<\/p>\n<p>However, I\u2019ve only used this skill every once in a while, so when needed, I had to sift through an endless list of courses until I could find the perfect fit. I can confidently say that the courses in the list will help you deliver great results, even though they cost a fraction of a traditional workshop.<\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b>, during my research, I came across courses that felt well-made but weren\u2019t well-known. If I adopted a purely data-centric approach, I would have to leave those courses out of the ranking, if only because they had fewer enrollments.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I favored a holistic approach. I\u2019ve included more personal picks that hopefully surprise those of you who have already seen or taken the more popular Copywriting courses and are looking for something a bit different. You can also clearly see courses aimed at specific expertise as in blog copy, ad copy, freelancing, landing pages, emails, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, my experience as a lifelong learner, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking. So far, I\u2019ve spent more than 16 hours building this ranking, and I intend to continue updating it in the future.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, copywriting can be used by anyone. I tried to keep this list as diverse as possible with content for novice copywriters, 100% inexperienced beginners, small business owners, and other professionals interested in developing a new skill.<\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Statistics<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some aggregate stats about the ranking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Together, they account for 319,657 enrollments, without accounting for YouTube views.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">LinkedIn Learning and Udemy, with 4 courses each, are the most featured providers in the ranking.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The single most popular course in the ranking has over 160k enrollments.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Three courses are entirely free, ten courses are paid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s go through the top picks.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-1\">1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/udemy-copywriter-32281\">155 Years of Copywriting Insights Taught In 1.5 Hour Course!
