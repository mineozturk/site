These people are your existing or potential customers who can help broaden your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Emails can be in the form of advertisements, business requests or donations, with the objective of building loyalty, trust and brand awareness.<\/p>\n<h3>Why are Email Marketing skills important?<\/h3>\n<p>Email marketing has a return of investment <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/email-marketing-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(ROI) of $36 for every $1 spent<\/a>, which means that if you spend $1, you\u2019ll get $35 back. In 2019, there were 3.9 billion email users in the world. This number is expected to grow to 4.48 billion by 2024. That&#8217;s half the world\u2019s population!<\/p>\n<p>It has been seen that 72% of US consumers prefer email marketing over other types of promotion. A recent study by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.litmus.com\/resources\/state-of-email\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Litmus<\/a> shows that consumers project email marketing to be the most relevant marketing channel in the next 10 years.<\/p>\n<p>According to the US Burning Glass Labor Insight Report, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/marketing\/research\/state-of-digital-commerce-sem-digcomm?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GML_NA_2021_GML_CPC_LG1_ALWAYSON&amp;utm_adgroup=130458827183&amp;utm_term=growth%20in%20e%20commerce&amp;ad=572772144918&amp;matchtype=p&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwrqqSBhBbEiwAlQeqGlylXrxqpD1b5KwbKUdVkjnFH8T-gSoCT0KxgLloBORIsYegpy7CqRoCFRUQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86% of business leaders<\/a> report that digital commerce will be the most important route to growth. There are 218,000 U.S. job openings in this growing field, with a median entry-level salary of $51,000.<\/p>\n<h3>What is my experience with Email Marketing?<\/h3>\n<p>As a Generalist at Class Central, a large part of my job is to send emails to instructors to inform them of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BCGs<\/a>. If it clicks, we get to form stronger bonds with them, which potentially increases our reach to more learners.<\/p>\n<p>My colleague, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@Pat<\/a>, also sends emails to learners who might want to write reviews for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Report<\/a>. She successfully encourages them, and we have published many review articles as a result. We also send monthly newsletters to our subscribers to increase brand awareness, showcase most popular topics, and advertise new products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Besides that, I am a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/archisha-bhar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guided Project Instructor<\/a> and a Beta Tester at Coursera, having tested many courses before they\u2019re officially launched.
