A crucial part of any language is its grammar. But for some, it might be a daunting task. \u201cHow do they write so well while I struggle to get a sentence right?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re one of them, don\u2019t worry. Grammar is not a mathematical formula. In fact, it\u2019s simply the way a language has developed\u2026 just like your own language. So you actually know a lot of grammar already! And with so many online courses today, learning English grammar is a piece of cake.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, I\u2019ve selected the 10 best free and paid English grammar online courses for you from the 750+ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subject\/grammar-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">English grammar<\/a> courses on our catalog by following a well-defined methodology that you can find below.

This is true for any language. For English, this includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and whole texts.<\/p>\n<p><i>Rule<\/i> is the bare minimum of what it takes to make your language understandable by other people. On the other hand, <i>convention<\/i> is a generally accepted principle, which is context dependent.<\/p>\n<p>There are many kinds of English, and their <i>conventions<\/i> may differ. But the basics (the <i>rules<\/i>) are the same. In fact, we use different kinds of grammar throughout the day depending on the context.<\/p>\n<h3>Why are English Grammar Skills Important?<\/h3>\n<p>English is the most popular language today, spoken by a whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.452 billion people worldwide<\/a>, according to <i>Ethnologue (2022, 25th edition)<\/i>! And any language needs its grammar.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the many reasons why English (and so its grammar) skills are important:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Academic purpose<\/b> &#8211; the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/08\/english-universal-language-science-research\/400919\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">majority of scientific papers are published in English<\/a> nowadays, being prevalent even in non-English speaking countries such as India, Germany, France, and Spain.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>English for traveling abroad<\/b> &#8211; most tourist places in the world will have a pamphlet and a tourist guide who speaks English, also it\u2019s really helpful with handling immigration, restaurants and hotels in general, and also communication with foreigners.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>English for connecting with people worldwide<\/b> &#8211; the internet is in English and there is no denying that. If you want to connect with people from all over the world such as reddit communities or study groups such as Class Central Cohorts and bootcamps, you have to communicate well in English.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>English for business<\/b> &#8211; English has become the standard language for doing business and for online learning. So, I can\u2019t emphasize enough the importance of learning good grammar since my work involves writing articles in English with the help of an international team at Class Central.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What is My Experience with English Grammar?<\/h3>\n<p>I have been learning English grammar since my early school days. Even in college, I had to learn English grammar as part of my curriculum. Other than that, my habit of reading English fiction has polished my grammar.<\/p>\n<p>Most important of all, I am a writer here at Class Central. To this day, I\u2019m learning something new while writing my articles. My colleagues, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@Pat<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@Manoel<\/a> (two awesome people), have helped me improve my writing at every step.<\/p>\n<p>Besides that, I am a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/archisha-bhar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guided Project Instructor<\/a> and a Beta Tester at Coursera, having tested many courses before they\u2019re officially launched. I have taken <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@archisha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 50 online courses<\/a> in various subjects.<\/p>\n<p>My experience as an online learner and teacher has given me some perspective on what to look for in an online course. I used my experience to evaluate each course in this list.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79248 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology I used in previous rankings (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

So far, I\u2019ve spent more than 10 hours building this list, and I\u2019ll continue to update it.<\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Statistics<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some statistics regarding this course ranking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Combined, these courses have accrued nearly <b>1M<\/b> enrollments.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">7 courses are <b>free<\/b> or <b>free-to-audit<\/b> and 3 courses are <b>paid<\/b>.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The most-represented course provider in the ranking is <b>Coursera<\/b>, with 4 specializations and 1 course.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">All 10 courses and specializations are in English.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Combined, these courses have been bookmarked nearly <b>15.7K<\/b> times on Class Central, while the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subject\/grammar-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">English grammar<\/a> subject has been bookmarked over <b>300.3K<\/b> times on Class Central, and accounts for over 750 courses in Class Central catalog.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So without further ado, let\u2019s get to my picks for the best English grammar online courses.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-1\">1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/khan-academy-grammar-102531\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammar (Khan Academy)<\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_81870\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81870\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-81870 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/1.-Grammar-Khan-Academy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/1.-Grammar-Khan-Academy.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/1.-Grammar-Khan-Academy-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/1.-Grammar-Khan-Academy-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-81870\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Explanation of nouns<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>My first pick for the best English grammar online course is the <b>free<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/khan-academy-grammar-102531\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Grammar<\/i><\/a>, offered by Khan Academy.<\/p>\n<p>This one is my personal favorite. I love the way Khan Academy teaches, which is very different from traditional tutorials or courses. They have really fun teachers who know how to grab the student\u2019s attention, particularly through their boardwork (as you can see above!).<\/p>\n<p>Even though their courses are primarily made for school kids, I believe anyone can learn anything at any age. And a big plus point of their classes is that they focus on strengthening the basics, which is often overlooked elsewhere. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve put this course at #1.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>First, you\u2019ll be introduced to nouns.

It covers concepts such as noun clauses, conditionals, verb tenses, and punctuations. This specialization is helpful for both non-native and native English speakers in improving fluency and accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>This specialization consists of the following four courses:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/verb-passives-7283\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verb Tenses and Passives<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/conjunctions-connectives-adverb-clauses-7281\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conjunctions, Connectives, and Adverb Clauses<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/noun-clauses-conditionals-7282\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noun Clauses and Conditionals<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/advanced-grammar-project-7285\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced Grammar &amp; Punctuation Project<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<h4>Verb Tenses and Passives<\/h4>\n<p>In this course, you\u2019ll first review verb tenses. You&#8217;ll then cover all 12 of the English verb tenses and passive verb forms, and finish the course by learning how to blend these tenses like native speakers.<\/p>\n<h4>Conjunctions, Connectives, and Adverb Clauses<\/h4>\n<p>In this course, you\u2019ll learn about two types of conjunctions, many types of connectives, and adverb clauses. You&#8217;ll also learn how to punctuate these expressions and the types of sentences they create.<\/p>\n<h4>Noun Clauses and Conditionals<\/h4>\n<p>In this course, you\u2019ll learn about the advanced grammar concepts of noun clauses and conditionals. You\u2019ll learn several different types of each and get to practice using them.<\/p>\n<h4>Advanced Grammar &amp; Punctuation Project<\/h4>\n<p>In this course, you will create a grammar portfolio of the English grammatical structures that you studied in the preceding courses. Your portfolio will include several items that you create, and show the proper use of grammar.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The specialization is broken down into 4 courses, and the first 3 courses are broken down into 4 modules. Each module involves about 2 to 3 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos, readings and practice quizzes.<\/p>\n<p>The final course is a capstone project, broken down into 6 modules. Here, you will apply all that you have learned in this specialization.<\/p>\n<p>Paid learners can complete all the graded assignments to earn a course-completion certificate for each course, and a separate specialization certificate for the entire specialization. So you get 5 certificates altogether if you make it to the end!<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>University of California, Irvine<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Brad Gilpin, Emily Ellis, Nicole Jacobs, Tamy Chapman<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Advanced<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>110 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>62.7K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.8\/5.0 (1.7K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>One Thing to Note<\/h3>\n<p>You can enroll into the final course, Intermediate Grammar Project, only if you have completed courses 1 to 3 of the specialization.<\/p>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ellis has done her M.A. in TESL\/TEFL and in Spanish from Colorado State University.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">She has taught both Spanish and English at the University of Denver and Colorado State University, and has been teaching English at UCI Extension since 2011.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">She is a top instructor at Coursera.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/advanced-grammar-punctuation-18772\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-10\">10. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-learn-english-grammar-102527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn English grammar (English with Alex \u00b7 engVid English Classes)<\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_81861\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81861\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-81861 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/10.-Learn-English-Grammar-English-with-Alex-\u00b7-engVid-English-Classes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/10.-Learn-English-Grammar-English-with-Alex-\u00b7-engVid-English-Classes.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/10.-Learn-English-Grammar-English-with-Alex-\u00b7-engVid-English-Classes-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/10.-Learn-English-Grammar-English-with-Alex-\u00b7-engVid-English-Classes-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-81861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex, instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>My tenth pick for the best English grammar online course is the <b>free<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-learn-english-grammar-102527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Learn English grammar<\/i><\/a>, offered by English with Alex \u00b7 engVid English Classes on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>Learn intermediate English grammar with Alex from engVid!
