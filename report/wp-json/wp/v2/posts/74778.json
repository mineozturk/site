While a few members of the Study Group managed to finish it, the course\u2019s hefty workload also got the best of some of us, including myself \u2014 I threw in the towel a few weeks in.<\/p>\n<p>So when I got the opportunity to pick our next course options, I tried to mix things up a bit. I included a couple of courses about subjects I thought could make for a nice change of pace: one course was about sleep; another was about nutrition; both were fairly short courses.<\/p>\n<p>As a fully remote team distributed across time zones ranging from the US&#8217; west coast to Australia\u2019s east coast, it can be tricky to keep a 9\u20135 work schedule. When we have team meetings, for instance, some team members inevitably have to wake up early or stay up late. So we could probably all use a little help improving our sleep.<\/p>\n<p>We voted to pick which course to tackle next, and the sleep course won by a hair. And just like that, Class Central\u2019s Study Group embarked on a journey toward longer, more restful sleep. Or so we hoped.<\/p>\n<h2>Overview<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/sleep-deprivation-16935\">Sleep Deprivation: Habits, Solutions and Strategies<\/a> is offered by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/university\/umich\">University of Michigan<\/a> on several platforms, including FutureLearn, which is where we decided to take the course. The course is a <em>teach-out<\/em>, which Michigan describes as mini-courses that try to address topics relevant to today\u2019s society \u2014 in this particular case, sleep deprivation.<\/p>\n<p>The mini-course takes about four hours to complete. It is taught by a large team of instructors that includes Dr. Anita Shelgikar, Dr. Cathy Goldstein, and Dr. Ronald Chervin. And it approaches the topic of sleep deprivation through a wide variety of teaching styles, including expert interviews, blackboard explanations, and round tables.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I noticed is that, with the exception of a few videos, the course can practically be treated as a podcast, since it favors teaching through conversation rather than visual cues.<\/p>\n<p>The course is split into two sections. The first section focuses on theory: it explains what sleep deprivation is and the dangers it entails, it delves into sleep cycles and the science that underpins them, and it allows learners to take a test to evaluate their level of sleepiness. The second section is more practical: it gives concrete advice on how to improve your sleep.<\/p>\n<h2>Teaching Style<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74787\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74787\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blackboard.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-74787 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blackboard-1024x560.png\" alt=\"Sleep cycles\" width=\"1024\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blackboard-1024x560.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blackboard-300x164.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blackboard-768x420.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blackboard.png 1104w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74787\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sleep cycles and their mechanisms<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A few videos into the course, it became readily apparent that no efforts nor expenses were spared developing the course. We\u2019re a far cry from a PowerPoint presentation voiced over by a lone instructor. Instead, the course is taught by a team of six physicians and features multiple guest speakers. The video lessons approach the topic of sleep in a wide variety of ways, often relying on conversation as a conduit to learning.<\/p>\n<p>The course avoids falling into a routine. Some lessons involve choreographed exchanges between instructors on topics such as the prevalence of sleep deprivation in today\u2019s world. Others take it to the blackboard for technical explanations about the science that underpins sleep. And others use props to illustrate concepts, such as how to create a bedtime routine.<\/p>\n<p>None of these approaches is particularly unique. But online courses typically use a single approach, while this course uses a wide variety of them. Videos are crisp and the instructional design is on point. There\u2019s definitely a noticeable sense of quality to the course.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. Some of the best online courses I\u2019ve taken simply involved a slides presentation and a passionate instructor. But admittedly, in this course, the variety helped keep me engaged, while a drier approach to the subject might have put me to sleep.<\/p>\n<h2>Content<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74796\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74796\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/profs-sleep-course.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74796\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/profs-sleep-course-1024x561.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/profs-sleep-course-1024x561.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/profs-sleep-course-300x164.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/profs-sleep-course-768x421.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/profs-sleep-course.png 1103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74796\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Round table about sleep deprivation&#8217;s health risks<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While in terms of form, the course was original in its variety, in terms of content, it turned out to be more standard. Personally, I learned a lot during the first half of the course, and I particularly enjoyed the videos about sleep cycles, and their mechanisms and chemistry.<\/p>\n<p>But the second part of the course \u2014 the one about how to sleep better \u2014 was the one I think most of us were looking forward to. Unfortunately, for several of us, this part proved to be less useful than we\u2019d hope. To improve your sleep, instructors suggest among others:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a bedtime routine to help you relax.<\/li>\n<li>Wearing a sleep tracker to monitor your sleep.<\/li>\n<li>Going to bed at the same time every day, weekends included.<\/li>\n<li>Avoiding screens, heavy meals, and intense exercise near bedtime.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@dhawal\">@dhawal<\/a> found that most of these suggestions were things he\u2019d heard before. And I (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\">@manoel<\/a>) felt the same way. But in my case at least, these suggestions definitely bear repeating, since despite having heard them before, I\u2019ve yet to follow most of them consistently.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\">@pat<\/a>, by contrast, did try to follow these tips consistently before. But she found that they didn\u2019t make a whole lot of difference in her case. This raises the question: if you have trouble sleeping, and you\u2019ve already tried the \u201cstandard\u201d suggestions, what should you try next?<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s only so much you can cover in a four-hour course. So the course doesn\u2019t really answer this question. This limitation is compounded by the fact that a significant number of video lessons are dedicated to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation on health:<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>\u201c<em>Common solutions [to sleep deprivation] were discussed, but not a lot was offered for people who tried them but still have trouble sleeping,<\/em>\u201d explains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@pat\">@pat<\/a>, adding via DM \u201c<em>So, hearing about the health issues of sleep deprivation didn&#8217;t help my frame of mind!<\/em>\u201d<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>So if you\u2019ve already explored the subject of sleep and are looking for an in-depth take, you may want to turn toward a full-fledged course such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/sleep-3233\">Sleep: Neurobiology, Medicine, and Society<\/a>, which features some of the same instructors but has over 20 hours of content.<\/p>\n<p>However, for those looking for a gentle introduction to sleep science and for general advice on how to improve your sleep, I think <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/sleep-deprivation-16935\">this mini-course<\/a> could be a great fit. This has been echoed by other members of our Study Group.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@vishnu\">@vishnu<\/a> found that the course helped him understand different sleep patterns. And one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@ruima\">@rui<\/a>\u2019s takeaways was that the \u201c<em>most direct solution [to sleep deprivation] is sticking to a strict bedtime routine,<\/em>\u201d a suggestion I\u2019ve also been following with some success since finishing the course \u2014 baby steps!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Class
