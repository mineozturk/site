Each course is made of units, each unit is made of lessons; courses can stack up to Specializations or XSeries; these can stack up to partial degrees such as MicroMasters, or all the way up to full degrees (though only some microcredentials are structured as pieces of degrees).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Central\u00a0<\/strong>has been keeping track of MOOC-based microcredentials ever since edX launched the first one, Xseries back in 2013. Since then all the major providers have launched at least one microcredential, and in many cases, the providers have gone ahead to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2016-11-03-why-udacity-and-edx-want-to-trademark-the-degrees-of-the-future-and-what-s-at-stake-for-students\">trademark<\/a> them. Each provider is competing to build the credential of the future.<\/p>\n<p>Class Central&#8217;s Laurie Pickard analyzed these 11 different types of microcredentials offered by five different platforms. You can find the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-microcredentials-analysis-2018\/\">analysis here<\/a>. Laurie will also be presenting her results at the upcoming<a href=\"http:\/\/learningwithmoocs2018.org\/index.php\"> Learning With MOOCs 2018 <\/a>conference held at the end of September, in Madrid. Laurie has also proposed a session on microcredentials at next year&#8217;s SXSW EDU conference in Austin, TX. You can vote for her session <a href=\"https:\/\/panelpicker.sxsw.com\/vote\/84706\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at published data about the cost, time, effort required to complete these different microcredentials, it is clear that there is very little standardization among them. There is as much if not more variability within each type of microcredential as across types of microcredential.\u00a0This variability and lack of standardization poses a problem for both learners and employers, as it makes it difficult to compare the various microcredentials. While all employers understand that a master\u2019s degree signifies a higher level of preparation than a bachelor\u2019s degree, it is impossible to say whether a Udacity Nanodegree prepares a person more or better than an edX Professional Certificate or a Coursera Specialization.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Previous editions of MOOCWatch:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-become-big-business\/\">MOOCWatch #17: MOOCs Become Big Business<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocwatch-16-mooc-providers-target-degrees\/\">MOOCWatch #16:\u00a0MOOC Providers Target Degrees<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocwatch-15-moocs-lifelong-learners\/\">MOOCWatch #15: MOOCs Find Their Audience\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocwatch-april-2017-shrinking-free\/\">MOOCWatch #14: The Shrinking of Free\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>If you like MOOCWatch, I would also recommend subscribing to FutureLearn\u2019s Chris Fellingham\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/tinyletter.com\/ChrisFellingham\">Human Learning newsletter<\/a>\u00a0or Sophie Bailey\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/podcast\/the-edtech-podcast\/id1107282759?mt=2\">The Edtech Podcast<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><!-- MailChimp for WordPress v3.1.5 - https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/mailchimp-for-wp\/ --><\/p>\n<form id=\"mc4wp-form-2\" class=\"mc4wp-form mc4wp-form-63147 mc4wp-form-theme mc4wp-form-theme-blue\" method=\"post\" data-id=\"63147\" data-name=\"MOOCWatch Signup\">\n<div class=\"mc4wp-form-fields\">\n<h4>Understand what\u2019s going on in the World of MOOCs<\/h4>\n<p>Receive a monthly digest of everything related to MOOCs<\/p>\n<p><input name=\"EMAIL\" required=\"\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" \/><\/p>\n<p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up for MOOCWatch\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"><input tabindex=\"-1\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"_mc4wp_honeypot\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<p><input name=\"_mc4wp_timestamp\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1494748794\" \/><input name=\"_mc4wp_form_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"63147\" \/><input name=\"_mc4wp_form_element_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"mc4wp-form-2\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mc4wp-response\"><\/div>\n<\/form>\n<p><!-- \/ MailChimp for WordPress Plugin --><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>TOP STORIES<\/h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-microcredentials-analysis-2018\/\">MANY OPTIONS BUT LITTLE CONSISTENCY<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0via <em>Class Central<br \/>\n<\/em>Analysis of 450 MOOC-based microcredentilas (11 different types).\u00a0\u00a0The analysis points to a lack of consistency among microcredentials, making it difficult to compare them or interpret their significance, for prospective learners and employers alike.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/learningwithmoocs2018.org\/index.php\">LEARNING WITH MOOCS<\/a><br \/>\n<\/strong>The fifth annual Learning With MOOCS\u00a0(LWLMOOCS) conference takes place from\u00a026-28 September 2018.\u00a0LWMOOCS 2018 will be held at UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia) and UPM (Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid), in Madrid, Spain.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-67621\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-27-LWMOOCS-V-\u2013-Learning-with-MOOCs-2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-27-LWMOOCS-V-\u2013-Learning-with-MOOCs-2018.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-27-LWMOOCS-V-\u2013-Learning-with-MOOCs-2018-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-27-LWMOOCS-V-\u2013-Learning-with-MOOCs-2018-768x435.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-27-LWMOOCS-V-\u2013-Learning-with-MOOCs-2018-1024x580.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/second-wave-of-mooc-hype\/\">MOOC HYPE 2.0<\/a><\/strong> via <em>Class Central<br \/>\n<\/em>A few months of ago I speculated that online degrees are the second wave of MOOC hype.
