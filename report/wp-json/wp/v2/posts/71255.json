But a month later, they&#8217;re dragging their feet to process cancellations, resulting in undue charges for learners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong> (May 5, 2020): In addition, Max in the comments notes that Udacity changed its Nanodegree refund policy. Nanodegrees used to have a 7-days refund window. But as of yesterday, they only have a <a href=\"https:\/\/udacity.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360015466632-What-is-your-refund-or-cancellation-policy-\">2-days refund window<\/a>, except in the EU where it&#8217;s 14 days, likely because of EU&#8217;s stronger consumer protection laws.<\/p>\n<h2>Cancellations Then: Two Clicks and Done<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve completed several Nanodegrees over the years and rather enjoyed them.

The Nanodegree included a free trial. By the end of the free trial, I had completed all the content available: the Nanodegree was still in development, so content was being released on a schedule. I didn\u2019t want to wait, so I decided to cancel my free trial.<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>cancelling a Nanodegree used to be a two-click process<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back then, the cancellation process was simple: I went to my payment settings, clicked <em>Cancel<\/em>, and confirmed. So cancelling a Nanodegree used to be a two-click process. Several of my colleagues have confirmed this. But things have changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Cancellations Now: About a Week<\/h2>\n<p>In March, Udacity joined the chorus of companies offering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/free-online-learning-coronavirus\/\">free content because of the pandemic<\/a>. More specifically, during the last week of March, Udacity began offering one-month Nanodegree free trials. The offer was later extended through April.<\/p>\n<p>Like many, I jumped on the opportunity to try one of Udacity\u2019s newer Nanodegrees. I enrolled in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229-18201\">Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch<\/a>\u00a0with the intention of making the most out of the free month and then potentially moving to a paid subscription.<\/p>\n<p>But three weeks into the Nanodegree, a colleague who\u2019d also enrolled in one told me he was having a hard time cancelling his free trial. Not wanting to be charged unduly, I decided to also cancel mine. But this proved to be a challenge.<\/p>\n<h3>First Cancellation Attempt<\/h3>\n<p>The first time I tried to cancel, it was via my mobile phone, since I was on the move. I logged into Udacity, went to my settings, and clicked <em>Cancel<\/em>. But instead of prompting me to confirm, the site said that to cancel, I\u2019d have to chat with a Udacity advisor. I waited two hours for an advisor, but as you can see below, they never showed up.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71351\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71351\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-71351\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat-1024x658.png\" alt=\"Trying to cancel a Nanodegree via chat\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat-1024x658.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat-768x494.png 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat-1536x987.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/free-trial-cancel-attempt-via-chat-2048x1317.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-71351\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Waiting for a Udacity advisor&#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3>Second Cancellation Attempt<\/h3>\n<p>The second time I tried to cancel, it was via my desktop computer. This time, the site said that to cancel, I\u2019d have to email Udacity. Reluctantly, I did. Anticipating friction, I stated in my email that I wasn\u2019t interested in other offers \u2014 I just wanted to cancel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>it took five days and six emails for my cancellation to go through<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s the email exchange timeline:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Day 1<\/strong>: I email Udacity requesting the cancellation of my free trial. They send me a generic email stating that I\u2019ll likely hear back from them within two days.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Day 2<\/strong>: They offer me a discount to keep my Nanodegree subscription. I decline and reiterate that I just want to cancel.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Day 3<\/strong>: Unprompted, they send me the same generic email as before, stating that I\u2019ll likely hear back from them within two days.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Day 4<\/strong>: Again, they send me the same generic email.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Day 5<\/strong>: Finally, they confirm the cancellation of my free trial.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In total, it took five days and six emails for my cancellation to go through. And that\u2019s because I responded immediately. If I\u2019d waited the next day, it might have taken a week, like it did for a colleague of mine, and I would have been charged.<\/p>\n<h2>Growing Complaints<\/h2>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>Udacity chose to replace quick, automatic cancellations with slow, manual ones in an attempt to retain learners through inconvenience<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s now been over a month since Udacity started offering one-month free trials. So naturally, many learners are trying to cancel their subscription, only to discover it&#8217;s not as easy as expected. Some have taken to social media to voice their frustration.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I like Udacity but their latest practice is very shady.
