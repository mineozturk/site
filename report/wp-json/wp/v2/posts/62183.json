Even now more MOOCs are offered in months coinciding with the fall and spring semester.<\/p>\n<p>An issue with these session based MOOCs has been that students were never sure when the course would be offered again, or even <em>if<\/em> it would be offered again. Popular courses, such as Dan Ariely&#8217;s <a title=\"A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/424\/coursera-a-beginner-s-guide-to-irrational-behavior\" target=\"_blank\">A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Irrational Behavior<\/a>, have been taken off of Coursera&#8217;s website. In fact, 55% of all courses listed on Class Central do not have an upcoming start date. We built <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\">MOOC Tracker<\/a>, the tagline of which is &#8220;<em>Never Miss a Course<\/em>,&#8221; specifically to solve the problem of MOOCs having unpredictable schedules.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity was the first provider to abandon this scheduled paradigm (back in 2012). The company adopted a self-paced model \u2014 users can sign up and complete a course at their own pace (which allows flexibility for students, and also happens to fit well with Udacity\u2019s revenue model based on monthly subscriptions). This idea is closer to the self paced content available on Udemy or Lynda.com.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>I prefer session-based courses. I feel like I learn more from\u00a0them, the forums are usually much more active and finishing feels like more of an accomplishment.<br \/>\n&#8211; Class Central User <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@greg\">Greg Hamel<\/a><span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As we noted in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-stats-and-trends-2014\/\">2014 Roundup of the MOOC Space<\/a>, other providers also began to adopt this model. In 2014, Coursera started re-building their platform to support these &#8220;always available&#8221; courses. They made a big push toward what they called &#8220;On Demand&#8221; courses. Many of the older session-based courses have been moved to this new On Demand platform, and the bulk of Coursera&#8217;s new courses are directly offered in the On Demand format. Currently close to 300 Coursera courses are available as self-paced courses.<\/p>\n<p>EdX, too, have started making their courses self paced. The MOOC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/circuits-electronics-1-basic-circuit-mitx-6-002-1x\" target=\"_blank\">Circuits and Electronics<\/a>, taught by edX&#8217;s CEO Anant Agrawal, was the first course on the\u00a0 edX platform (which was called MITx back then); the course has since been broken down into three parts and they are available as self paced courses. At the time of writing 180 courses, which account for almost 25% of all edX courses, are now available as self paced MOOCs.<\/p>\n<h2>Self Paced vs. Session Based Courses<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>I have taken several scheduled courses, but not a single self paced course. The main reason is that the deadline is motivating.<br \/>\n&#8211; Class Central user <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@henrik\">Henrik Warne<\/a><span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Self paced courses are a clear boon to those students who want scheduling flexibility, but they also remove key elements that have been part of the \u201cMOOC\u201d formula that has been so popular. Such elements include the benefits of tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) students taking the course together and learning at the same pace.\u00a0According to Class Central user\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@greg\">Greg Hamel<\/a>, who has completed more than one hundred MOOCs: &#8220;<em>Lack of schedule means students are not all learning the same material at the same time. This makes it harder to get help and discuss course content.<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another aspect of self paced courses is the lack of deadlines. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/u\/43904\">Ronny De Winter<\/a>, another Class Central user: &#8220;<em>Strict deadlines help me in planning and scheduling my course work.<\/em>&#8221; He thinks some On Demand courses tend to reduce down to video lectures combined with multiple-choice quizzes, which is a very poor and limited use of today&#8217;s MOOC capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>In an informal survey of\u00a0Class Central users who have done multiple MOOCs , most of those surveyed preferred session based courses over self paced courses. But on a separate Twitter poll, two-thirds of the respondents preferred Self Paced courses.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Poll: Which courses do you prefer? <br \/>1.
