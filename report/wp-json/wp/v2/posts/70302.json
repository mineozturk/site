Dev Bootcamp, one of the first bootcamps and a high profile acquisition of the Kaplan Group, had shut down.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref1\" href=\"#ftnt1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Iron Yard followed Dev Bootcamp\u2019s lead in less than a few weeks,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref2\" href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and industry observers predicted that the industry would see consolidation.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref3\" href=\"#ftnt3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup> <sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref4\" href=\"#ftnt4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Rick O\u2019Donnell, the CEO of Skills Fund, a student loan provider for bootcamps and other vocational training programs, told <\/span><span class=\"c2 c12\">Inside Higher Ed<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> that Skills Fund had \u201cbeen forecasting a consolidation wave within the boot-camp industry; there are simply too many schools for everyone to be profitable,\u201d<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref5\" href=\"#ftnt5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and this sentiment was echoed in other articles about the industry.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref6\" href=\"#ftnt6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Following that prediction, the bootcamp industry saw additional closures (e.g. Learners Guild<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref7\" href=\"#ftnt7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\">) and acquisitions (e.g. Flatiron, General Assembly, Bloc, Hack Reactor, Fullstack Academy, and Thinkful). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">However, despite the consolidation of older bootcamps, new <\/span><span class=\"c2\">bootcamps<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> such as Lambda School and Holberton School are gaining prominence while attracting significant press and policy maker attention. Sen. Chris Murphy named Holberton \u201cinnovator of the month\u201d<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref8\" href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and Sen. Todd Young toured the campus of Kenzie Academy.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref9\" href=\"#ftnt9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> The New York Times, Business Insider, and Bloomberg have all given Lambda School favorable coverage,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref10\" href=\"#ftnt10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup> <sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref11\" href=\"#ftnt11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup> <sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref12\" href=\"#ftnt12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> although Business Insider has subsequently published critical pieces about Lambda School.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref13\" href=\"#ftnt13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> It\u2019s striking how quickly the narrative has shifted from one of austerity to one of growth, and the narrative shift raises questions about what, if anything, has changed about the industry since 2017.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\" class=\"c16\">Methodology<\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\">This report relies on extensive literature reviews, data collected from LinkedIn, and interviews with bootcamp founders, employees, and students. Three bootcamp founders were interviewed, as well as five bootcamp employees, two of whom were c-level executives.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"scale\" class=\"c28\"><span class=\"c3 c15\">Can Bootcamps Scale Effectively?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c40\">Coding<\/span> bootcamps<span class=\"c2\"> make up a very small portion of the for-profit education industry. Industry reported figures claim that 15,429 students attended coding bootcamps during 2018, and that 1<\/span>6,190 attended during 2017<span class=\"c2\">.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref14\" href=\"#ftnt14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> This number is dwarfed by the estimated 842,000 students who <\/span>enrolled at<span class=\"c2\"> for-profits in 2017<\/span>.<sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref15\" href=\"#ftnt15\">[15]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> Coding bootcamps might be the future of higher education but for now they are a very niche product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Estimated <\/span>enrollment<span class=\"c2\"> data from individual bootcamps (figure 1) show that it\u2019s very difficult for bootcamps to scale effectively. Although <\/span>many<span class=\"c2\"> bootcamps don\u2019t publish <\/span>enrollment<span class=\"c2\"> data, it\u2019s possible to estimate <\/span>enrollment<span class=\"c2\"> by using the alumni search tool available on most bootcamps\u2019 LinkedIn pages.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref16\" href=\"#ftnt16\">[16]<\/a><\/sup> T<span class=\"c2\">he search tool was used on December 11th, 2019 to obtain the estimates in figure 1. These estimates are not <\/span>perfect<span class=\"c2\">\u2014not every student has a LinkedIn profile and the figures for 2019 are incomplete\u2014but they are a way of assessing the relative growth and size of each bootcamp. The data shows that most bootcamps have difficulties enrolling more than a thousand students (Lambda School, General Assembly, and Flatiron School are the only <\/span><span class=\"c2\">bootcamps<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> tracked here to have done so). The data also suggests that year to year fluctuations in <\/span>enrollment<span class=\"c3 c2\"> are common.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"estimates\" class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c27 c33\">Figure 1:

Lambda School has expanded to Africa,<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref17\" href=\"#ftnt17\">[17]<\/a><\/sup> the EU,<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref18\" href=\"#ftnt18\">[18]<\/a><\/sup> and the UK,<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref19\" href=\"#ftnt19\">[19]<\/a><\/sup> and is reported to be planning an expansion to India.<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref20\" href=\"#ftnt20\">[20]<\/a><\/sup> One of Lambda School\u2019s selling points is its Income Share Agreement (ISA), and setting aside any other difficulties a school serving multiple countries would have to navigate, the challenge of adapting their ISA to multiple regulatory frameworks makes expanding to multiple countries a significant investment. Lambda School is not the only bootcamp expanding internationally: Holberton School has a presence in the US, Tunisia, Colombia, and Lebanon,<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref21\" href=\"#ftnt21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup> while Kenzie Academy announced an expansion to Brazil.<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref22\" href=\"#ftnt22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> International expansion suggests that bootcamps feel they need to look abroad to satisfy their goals for growing the business. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"uniteconomics\" class=\"c16\"><span class=\"c3 c15\">The Unit Economics of Short Term Education<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">An important question to answer is whether bootcamps are actually profitable businesses or if they\u2019re propped up by venture capital funding. This report estimates the revenue, expenses, and profit of a hypothetical bootcamp and finds that it\u2019s possible to run a profitable bootcamp that provides a reasonable quality of education. While the unit economics model described here is no substitute for looking at an actual balance sheet, it does provide a general overview of the business pressures bootcamps face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">According to an independent survey of the bootcamp industry by RTI, a typical bootcamp has a median tuition of $11,900 and an average length of 16.5 weeks, although this depends on a wide variety of factors, such as whether the bootcamp is full time or part time.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref23\" href=\"#ftnt23\">[23]<\/a><\/sup> The model bootcamp budget<span class=\"c2\"> therefore assume<\/span>s<span class=\"c2\"> revenue is $11,900 per student and <\/span>that each student attends for four months<span class=\"c2\">. Bootcamp tuition is significantly more expensive than a year\u2019s worth of 2018 in-state tuition for a 2-year college in the US ($3,243),<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref24\" href=\"#ftnt24\">[24]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> which makes sense as bootcamp tuition is not subsidized. <\/span>Costs can be broken<span class=\"c3 c2\"> into three categories: customer acquisition costs, instructional costs, and curriculum development costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">One<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> of the largest <\/span>drivers<span class=\"c2\"> of costs is the need to recruit students. On the very low end, affiliate programs such as Career Karma charge a $1,000 referral fee for each student recruited on its platform.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref25\" href=\"#ftnt25\">[25]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> However, as programs scale, it\u2019s likely that they will need to turn to larger platforms such as Facebook and Google, which are more expensive. For example, Lambda School is one of the fastest growing bootcamps and it uses Facebook<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref26\" href=\"#ftnt26\">[26]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> ads. This makes Lambda School similar to other large for-profits, which spend heavily on Facebook and Google Ads.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref27\" href=\"#ftnt27\">[27]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> For 2U, an OPM company that runs online programs for accredited universities, marketing and sales make up 19.2% of revenue.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref28\" href=\"#ftnt28\">[28]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Academic studies of for-profits estimate the customer acquisition costs at $4,000 per student,<\/span><sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref29\" href=\"#ftnt29\">[29]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and <\/span>it\u2019s reasonable to assume these costs are similar for bootcamps, so the $4,000 figure is used as an estimate in this report. <span class=\"c2\">At the moment, <\/span>it\u2019s difficult to<span class=\"c2\"> see a path to reducing these costs. <\/span>These costs are likely<span class=\"c3 c2\"> the same for high-quality and low-quality bootcamps (prospective students are uninformed consumers) and these costs likely increase as bootcamps scale and compete for the same students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">The second cost driver is instructional costs. Absent tools like AI and chatbots, bootcamps must employ instructors and budget for their salaries. The way many bootcamps structure their program is by using a combination of experienced instructors and teaching assistants. For example, the model schedule posted on Lambda School\u2019s website advertises a guided project with an instructor on Mondays through Thursdays, as well as daily meetings with a Team Lead.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref30\" href=\"#ftnt30\">[30]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> In Lambda School\u2019s case, Team Leads are Lambda students that take several weeks off from their studies to assist other students.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref31\" href=\"#ftnt31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> While the role of Team Lead doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be filled by current students, the example of Lambda School suggests that a good model for delivering instruction is to have a mix of experienced instructors and inexperienced teaching assistants. While the use of inexperienced instructors has received criticism, it can be beneficial to students: there are many repetitive tasks that experienced instructors don\u2019t have time for but which inexperienced instructors can do at an adequate level. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\">The<span class=\"c2\"> unit economics model<\/span> assumes <span class=\"c2\">an optimal ratio of 1 experienced instructor per 20 students, and 2 inexperienced instructors per 20 students. Truly experienced instructors are expensive and difficult to recruit because bootcamps will need to compete with tech companies to employ them. Teaching assistants are inexpensive, can be recruited from current and former students, and can do everything from career prep to grading to individualized tutoring. <\/span>It\u2019s reasonable to assume<span class=\"c3 c2\"> that experienced instructors come with a salary of $100,000, and inexperienced instructors come with a salary of $40,000. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Separate from instructional cost is the cost of developing and updating curriculum. It would be naive to believe that the curriculum of every bootcamp is bespoke and original, given the number of former bootcamp students and employees who go on to work for <\/span>or start <span class=\"c2\">competitors. There are good reasons to avoid developing curriculum, as developing curriculum is expensive. The best comparison point for curriculum development costs are MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses); practitioners reported that creating an hour of a video lecture involves 3-10 hours of preparation, depending on whether the curriculum was adopted from prior courses or created from scratch.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref32\" href=\"#ftnt32\">[32]<\/a><\/sup> The unit economics model assumes<span class=\"c2\"> that developing one hour of curriculum takes 10 hours of preparation in the first year of running a bootcamp, and that updating an hour of curriculum takes 3 hours every subsequent year. Lambda\u2019s model curriculum advertises 7 hours of instruction on Mondays<\/span> through <span class=\"c2\">Thursdays, which comes out to 28 hours of instruction per week.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref33\" href=\"#ftnt33\">[33]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Since the average bootcamp is 16.5 weeks long,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref34\" href=\"#ftnt34\">[34]<\/a><\/sup> there are<span class=\"c2\"> 463 hours of instruction that need to be developed, presumably by experienced instructors with salaries of $100,000 (i.e., $50 per hour). This comes out to $231,500 to initially develop the curriculum and $69,450 to update the curriculum each year after the first year. This doesn\u2019t take into account video production costs or the costs of creating interactive exercises, but it\u2019s not clear if these are necessary features <\/span>of a good<span class=\"c3 c2\"> curriculum or merely optional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Finally, there are administrative costs, which include office space and legal fees. Some of these costs can be eliminated by switching from in person instruction to online instruction (unlike office space, tools like Slack are cheap if not free). In many <\/span><span class=\"c2\">jurisdictions<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> there are fees associated with running a bootcamp; in California, <\/span><span class=\"c2\">bootcamps<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> and other nonaccredited schools are expected to register with the Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE).<\/span> However, these fees are not relevant to all bootcamps<span class=\"c2\"> as some bootcamps like Lambda School neglect to work with the relevant authorities.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref35\" href=\"#ftnt35\">[35]<\/a><\/sup> This report doesn\u2019t explicitly model these costs<span class=\"c3 c2\"> but it\u2019s important to be aware that they exist. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\">The unit economics model assumes<span class=\"c2\"> three cohorts of twenty students each year. <\/span>The model<span class=\"c2\"> then calculates the per-student costs, and subtracts the per-student costs from the per-student revenue of $11,900 (figure 2). <\/span>The<span class=\"c2\"> model suggests that it\u2019s well within the realm of possibility to operate a small bootcamp of reasonable quality and be profitable (see figure 2). Some bootcamps will save money by forgoing some of the expenses <\/span>the model<span class=\"c2\"> deems necessary; for example Holberton School does not have teachers which presumably increases their profits.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref36\" href=\"#ftnt36\">[36]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Other bootcamps will have additional expenses that <\/span>the model<span class=\"c2\"> doesn\u2019t view as being essential to running a bootcamp; for example Flatiron School developed a custom online learning platform.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref37\" href=\"#ftnt37\">[37]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Overall, it\u2019s likely that <\/span>the unit economics<span class=\"c2\"> calculations overestimate the profit a good bootcamp can earn in practice. That said, it\u2019s encouraging to know that running a <\/span>profitable<span class=\"c3 c2\"> short term education program is within the realm of possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calculations\" class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c3 c27\">Figure 2: Back of the Envelope Unit Economics Calculations<\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\"table text-small\">\n<table class=\"c31\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c34\"><span class=\"c1\">Expense<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c34\"><span class=\"c1\">Revenue<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Revenue per student<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">$11,900<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">1x Experienced instructor per 20 students<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">-$1,667<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">2x Teaching assistants per 20 students<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">-$1,333<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">CAC<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">-$4,000<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">First year curriculum costs<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">-$3,858<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Subsequent year curriculum costs<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">-$1, 157<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c2 c19 c12\">First year profit per student<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c2 c12 c19\">$1,042<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"c17\">\n<td class=\"c22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c2 c19 c12\">Subsequent year profit per student<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c2 c19 c12\">$3,743<\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"gap\" class=\"c16\"><span class=\"c3 c15\">Bootcamps and the Skills Gap<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Bootcamps are quick to cite skills gap statistics in support of their business models. The latest estimates for the number of unfilled technology jobs put the number at around 918,000.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref38\" href=\"#ftnt38\">[38]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> However, just because there is a skills gap of 918,000 jobs does not mean that there are 918,000 people who are a short bootcamp away from filling those jobs. Right now, the United States is experiencing low unemployment and a tight labor market (in August 2019 there were 0.9 unemployed workers for every job opening<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref39\" href=\"#ftnt39\">[39]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\">), which means that employers\u2019 hiring difficulties can be attributed to the fact that the workers they are trying to hire already have jobs. Bootcamps will have difficulties recruiting students for the same reasons employers have difficulties recruiting labor; people are already employed and thus have less of a need to reskill for new jobs. Enrollment in for-profit schools has declined by 51% since 2010 (from 1.7 million in 2010 to 842,000 students in 2017).<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref40\" href=\"#ftnt40\">[40]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> This decline mirrors the post-2010 recovery, and industry observers attribute declines in enrollment at for-profits like the University of Phoenix to low unemployment.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref41\" href=\"#ftnt41\">[41]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> If bootcamps sold training to employers, it would make sense to use the skills gap to estimate the size of the bootcamp market. But fundamentally, most bootcamps <\/span>sell<span class=\"c3 c2\"> training to students, and thus the skills gap is in many ways the opposite of the model needed to understand the bootcamp industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">There\u2019s evidence that employers are offering less training than they did historically, which presents a business opportunity to sell education to employers rather than students. Employer-paid training declined by 28% between 2001 and 2009.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref42\" href=\"#ftnt42\">[42]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> America\u2019s apprenticeship system is severely underdeveloped compared to countries like Germany.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref43\" href=\"#ftnt43\">[43]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> While 238,000 Americans began apprenticeships in 2018, these apprenticeships were concentrated in the construction industry,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref44\" href=\"#ftnt44\">[44]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and Germany (a smaller country) outperformed America with 520,332 apprenticeships in 2016.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref45\" href=\"#ftnt45\">[45]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> There is significant room for employers to commit resources to addressing the skills gap, and there are <\/span>potential<span class=\"c3 c2\"> business opportunities for education startups to sell training programs to companies struggling to fill high-demand positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\" class=\"c28\">Challenges Faced by Scaling Bootcamps<\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">The data shows that most bootcamps struggle to break a thousand students (figure 1). There are a number of reasons for this. First and foremost, the number of potential students who are not served by existing institutions is most likely significantly smaller than skills gap statistics<\/span> <span class=\"c2\">suggest (see previous section). This means that bootcamps will need to compete for students with both <\/span>other<span class=\"c2\"> bootcamps and with private, public, and for-profit institutions. As startups, bootcamps are at an immediate disadvantage as they do not have the brand recognition of <\/span>decades<span class=\"c2\"> old universities or the marketing sophistication of large for-profits. This is why many industry observers describe bootcamps competing for a small number of students, which <\/span>led<span class=\"c2\"> to consolidation <\/span>in<span class=\"c2\"> 2017.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref46\" href=\"#ftnt46\">[46]<\/a><\/sup> <sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref47\" href=\"#ftnt47\">[47]<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">When competing with other schools for limited students, bootcamps with high quality education are in many ways at a disadvantage. Students are not rational, fully informed consumers, and it\u2019s not clear that prospective students have the information needed to identify high quality bootcamps. Thus, it\u2019s not clear that investments in education lead to a decrease in marketing costs. From a margins perspective, low quality bootcamps can afford to put their resources into marketing, while high quality bootcamps will struggle to balance marketing and instructional costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">In addition, structural forces make it difficult for bootcamps to maintain educational quality while scaling. A key method of ensuring quality instruction is to maintain a ratio of instructors to students. Bootcamps teach programming, so instructors who are truly qualified have the option to work for other tech companies, which means it\u2019s expensive to employ good instructors and difficult to retain them. Rapid increases in enrollment present challenges in recruiting enough qualified instructors to maintain a specific instructor-student ratio. However, enrollment declines also present risks. Bootcamps will either have to fire instructors, which is a difficult pill to swallow given the effort spent recruiting them, or accept rising per student instruction costs (if the number of students halfs but the number of instructors stays constant, the cost<\/span> <span class=\"c2\">per<\/span> <span class=\"c2\">student of instruction doubles). The enrollment of <\/span>many<span class=\"c2\"> bootcamps fluctuates on a year-to-year basis (figure 1)<\/span>, which increases the difficulty of maintaining a specific instructor-student ratio.<\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Admissions policies are a tool that many bootcamps use to ensure the quality of their education, and admissions policies become difficult to implement as bootcamps scale. Acceptance rates are considered by some <\/span>observers<span class=\"c2\"> to be the best measure of the quality of a bootcamp,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref48\" href=\"#ftnt48\">[48]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> and there are reasons why good bootcamps will have stricter admissions policies. First, having a robust admissions policy helps maintain a stable number of students, which is essential to maintaining a specific instructor-student ratio. Bootcamps that accept a fraction of students who apply can increase their acceptance rate in off-years when applications are down, thereby ensuring a stable number of students every year. Second, to ensure that graduates are prepared at the end of the bootcamp to secure jobs, bootcamps need to ensure at the start of the program that their students have the necessary educational foundation to succeed. Ultimately, it becomes harder and harder for bootcamps to maintain admissions standards as they scale. First, the easiest and cheapest way to reduce customer acquisition costs is to stop turning away students. Second, relaxing admissions standards increases the size of the potential market a bootcamp can serve. It takes extraordinarily discipline to maintain admissions standards while growing a bootcamp. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">It\u2019s concerning that some bootcamps appear to be increasing the expenditure per student while rapidly <\/span>scaling<span class=\"c2\">. For example, Lambda School increased the length of its program from 7 months (30 weeks) in 2018<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref49\" href=\"#ftnt49\">[49]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> to 9 months in 2019,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref50\" href=\"#ftnt50\">[50]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and added additional services such as mental health counseling.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref51\" href=\"#ftnt51\">[51]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> Increasing the course length while dramatically scaling the size of the bootcamp is a sign that a bootcamp is not getting the results with a larger body of students that it got with a smaller body of students. It\u2019s possible that Lambda has not been able to maintain its instructor-student ratio or its admissions standards as it scales. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"outcomes\" class=\"c16\"><span class=\"c3 c15\">Coding Bootcamps and Student Outcomes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Since bootcamps are significantly more expensive than community colleges (compare average bootcamp tuition of $11,900 for a four month course<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref52\" href=\"#ftnt52\">[52]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> to the $3,243 price tag <\/span>of<span class=\"c2\"> a year\u2019s worth of 2018 in-state tuition at a 2-year university in the US<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref53\" href=\"#ftnt53\">[53]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\">), it\u2019s reasonable to ask whether bootcamps consistently place their students in relevant jobs. However, most bootcamps are not transparent about their outcomes data, making it difficult for prospective students to assess their effectiveness. While in some cases there have been legal consequences for this, such as a $375k fine brought against Flatiron School by the New York Attorney General,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref54\" href=\"#ftnt54\">[54]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> overall there doesn\u2019t appear to be consequences for publishing misleading outcomes data. It\u2019s unsurprising that the bootcamp world is awash with outcomes reports that haven\u2019t been independently verified, such as Holberton School\u2019s claim that 100% of April graduates find \u201cemployment opportunities\u201d in three months<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref55\" href=\"#ftnt55\">[55]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> or Lambda School\u2019s claim that \u201cevery single Lambda School graduate who has been on the job market for six months is either employed in a full-time role as a software engineer or has joined an early startup working for equity.\u201d<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref56\" href=\"#ftnt56\">[56]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> There is a clear need for accurate, verifiable data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Some in the bootcamp industry attempted to clean up misleading outcomes reports, which resulted in the creation of the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR), a self-regulatory body in the industry. Sheree Speakman, CIRR CEO, said in a statement that many bootcamps \u201creport outcomes to both their state regulatory agencies and to CIRR,\u201d and that while bootcamps aren&#8217;t required to submit data to CIRR, many voluntarily submit data \u201cto increase transparency and accessibility for prospective students who review outcomes in order to select a school and program.\u201d That said, CIRR is best understood as a failure to self-regulate. While the CIRR standards are themselves reasonably robust, it\u2019s questionable whether these standards are actually followed by CIRR members. For instance, CIRR standards mandate that bootcamps submit data twice a year and that these reports must be audited by a third party,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref57\" href=\"#ftnt57\">[57]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> but in practice many <\/span><span class=\"c2\">bootcamps<\/span><span class=\"c3 c2\"> only submit a report for a single cohort and then never return to submit subsequent reports or audit the submitted report. In fact, as of September 13, 2019, of the 25 bootcamps that have submitted outcomes reports to CIRR, 10 of those bootcamps submitted reports for only one reporting period.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref58\" href=\"#ftnt58\">[58]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Bootcamps\u2019 ability to cherry pick outcomes reports calls into question the effectiveness of CIRR\u2019s reporting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">The official data that is available indicates that leading bootcamps have poor outcomes. General Assembly, for instance, is obligated by California law to submit outcomes data to BPPE, which indicates that General Assembly fails to place a sizable portion of their students. For instance, for the 2017 Web Development Immersive, only 165 graduates out of an initial 310 students enrolled found full-time employment, meaning only 53% had successful outcomes.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref59\" href=\"#ftnt59\">[59]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> It\u2019s a similar story for the 2017 User Experience Design Immersive, where only 192 of 291 students enrolled found full-time employment, which is a 66% success rate.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref60\" href=\"#ftnt60\">[60]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> BPPE data is thus highly relevant to prospective students and should be available for all bootcamps. Unfortunately, some bootcamps such as Lambda School operate without BPPE approval (as a result, BPPE subsequently fined Lambda School and ordered it to cease operations<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref61\" href=\"#ftnt61\">[61]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"incentives\" class=\"c16\">Do ISAs Change the Structural Incentives of Running a Bootcamp?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Poor employment outcomes help explain why bootcamps are so quick to adopt Income Share Agreements (ISAs). An ISA is a financial product where a borrower gives up a percentage of their future (typically pre-tax<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref62\" href=\"#ftnt62\">[62]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\">) income in exchange for upfront funding. ISAs are frequently portrayed as a way of \u201celiminating risk\u201d for students,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref63\" href=\"#ftnt63\">[63]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and it\u2019s true that if only 53% of students get jobs then there is substantial risk in attending a program like the 2017 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly (General Assembly, like many other bootcamps, recently announced an Income Share Agreement<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref64\" href=\"#ftnt64\">[64]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\">). However, the notion of eliminating risk raises questions about the quality of education offered by many <\/span><span class=\"c2\">bootcamps<\/span><span class=\"c3 c2\"> as well as the appropriateness of ISAs as a financial product. Simply put, if the quality of education was better, then there would be less of a need to de-risk it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">The notion of de-risking education is at odds with another claim about ISAs: that they \u201calign incentives\u201d between students and school.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref65\" href=\"#ftnt65\">[65]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> What bootcamps which make this claim are often not transparent about is that ISAs are financed, which means that the ISA provider will sell the contract to third party investors.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref66\" href=\"#ftnt66\">[66]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> The lack of transparency can be very upsetting to students. For example, Pursuit (a coding bootcamp with an ISA) used to call their ISA program the \u201cPay It Forward commitment,\u201d<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref67\" href=\"#ftnt67\">[67]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> which was upsetting to some students<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref68\" href=\"#ftnt68\">[68]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> because their ISA payments actually went to investors,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref69\" href=\"#ftnt69\">[69]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> not to future students as was implied. Another example is Lambda School, which used to claim on its website that they \u201conly get paid when you do<\/span>,<span class=\"c2\">\u201d<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref70\" href=\"#ftnt70\">[70]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> which would contradict Wired reporting on how Lambda School<\/span>\u2019s ISA is financed.<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref71\" href=\"#ftnt71\">[71]<\/a><\/sup> T<span class=\"c2\">ruly aligned incentives as adver<\/span>tised<span class=\"c2\"> would mean keeping the ISAs on the books, so that bootcamps only earn money when their graduates earn money and so that the amount of money bootcamps earn is directly proportional to the amount of money graduates earn. It\u2019s possible that financed ISAs have some sort of financial incentive for bootcamps with good outcomes; such incentives <\/span>are not unique to ISAs and are offered by some private loans,<span class=\"c2\"> like Climb Credit, that are available to bootcamp students.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref72\" href=\"#ftnt72\">[72]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> However, students deserve to know the details of how exactly their ISA financing works and how exactly the incentives are aligned between student and school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">The biggest problem with ISAs from a business perspective would have to be their uncertain <\/span><span class=\"c2\">legal<\/span><span class=\"c2\"> status. The main legal debate over ISAs is whether ISAs are a new type of financial product that requires a new legal framework, or are they a new type of loan, in which case they would be subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending act, and state usury laws.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref73\" href=\"#ftnt73\">[73]<\/a><\/sup> <sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref74\" href=\"#ftnt74\">[74]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> These legal debates are often framed in terms of concern about potential harm to consumers, which makes sense as these laws are designed to protect consumers from abuse. However, a difficult question to answer is what would happen if ISA borrowers decided to simply refuse to pay the monthly payment? If ISAs were loans, then there would be an established legal framework that would <\/span>provide lenders with some amount of recourse<span class=\"c2\">. But since ISAs claim to not be loans (Lambda School\u2019s template ISA claims in all caps that \u201cthis agreement does not constitute a loan\u201d<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref75\" href=\"#ftnt75\">[75]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\">) it\u2019s not clear what recourse is available. Lambda School\u2019s template ISA contract mentions potentially garnishing wages (\u201cincluding any rights available to Company to garnish wages\u201d),<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref76\" href=\"#ftnt76\">[76]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> but it\u2019s not clear if this is something Lambda School actually has the ability to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Another challenge ISAs present to both students and bootcamps is it appears that in many cases bootcamps earn significantly less from ISAs than they would if students paid upfront. According to a Wired profile of Lambda School, Lambda School sells their ISAs at a deep discount relative to <\/span>tuition<span class=\"c2\">.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref77\" href=\"#ftnt77\">[77]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> The financing of ISAs has the potential to be a money losing scheme for bootcamps, which raises questions about whether it makes financial sense for bootcamps to offer ISAs. The low value for which ISAs are sold also raises consumer protection questions about whether ISAs enable price gouging. Students who pay full upfront tuition have a legitimate argument that they are overpaying relative to students with ISAs. And students with ISAs may very well wonder how much of their payments are directly going to <\/span>their bootcamp, and how much of their payments go to the middlemen financing the ISA.<\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Lambda School appears to be responding to these challenges by developing alternative mechanisms to collect ISA payments. Lambda School\u2019s template ISA contract requires borrowers to maintain an \u201capproved bank account\u201d that the ISA servicer has access to,<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref78\" href=\"#ftnt78\">[78]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> and <\/span>could potentially<span class=\"c2\"> require students to set up this bank account prior to beginning the course. <\/span>T<span class=\"c2\">hese tactics place severe restrictions on students\u2019 financial autonomy and should be concerning to any consumer protection advocate. Lambda School has also experimented with allowing employers to hire Lambda School students through Lambda School with a program called Lambda Studios.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref79\" href=\"#ftnt79\">[79]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> While Lambda Studios appears to be discontinued\u2014the relevant page on Lambda School\u2019s website no longer exists\u2014such employment relationships <\/span>have<span class=\"c2\"> the potential to allow bootcamps to take money from students<\/span>\u2019<span class=\"c3 c2\"> paychecks directly, or to fire students who miss ISA payments. Indeed, absent a new legal framework for ISAs, employing students directly might be the only way for ISA providers to guarantee that students will make payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\">In general, ISAs raise significant consumer protection and affordability issues. Analysis of ISAs offered by accredited universities has found that students pay significantly more with an ISA than they would pay with a conventional student loan.<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref80\" href=\"#ftnt80\">[80]<\/a><\/sup> <sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref81\" href=\"#ftnt81\">[81]<\/a><\/sup> <span class=\"c2\">ISAs also create significant potential for discrimination: income is correlated with demographic factors like race and gender, which gives ISA providers an incentive to offer more expensive ISA terms to <\/span>marginalized groups<span class=\"c2\">, and as a result there needs to be oversight and protections to ensure that discrimination does not occur.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref82\" href=\"#ftnt82\">[82]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c2\"> Finally, the consequences laid out in Lambda School\u2019s template ISA contract for missed payments have the potential to be punitive, especially given that the most likely reason for missed payments would be not having the money on hand. According to Lambda School\u2019s template ISA, students who miss payments are responsible for paying the entire $30,000 payment cap.<\/span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref83\" href=\"#ftnt83\">[83]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> Given that the payment cap is ostensibly for the purpose of protecting high earners from paying too much, it isn\u2019t appropriate for the payment cap to also be the amount students with missed payments are responsible for. ISAs deserve scrutiny from consumer protection groups, which would be beneficial for both the students themselves and also for schools who want confidence in the appropriateness of ISAs for their students. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" class=\"c16\">Conclusion: Investment Opportunities in Short Term Education<\/h2>\n<p class=\"c9\">Acquisitions of bootcamps are sometimes portrayed as evidence that bootcamps are valuable investment opportunities. The reality suggests that bootcamps are overvalued by investors and buyers alike. The recent example of K12\u2019s acquisition of Galvanize is instructive in this regard. Prior to the acquisition, Galvanize raised $167.5M from investors.<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref84\" href=\"#ftnt84\">[84]<\/a><\/sup> Galvanize was then bought for $165M, meaning that investors would be lucky if they broke even. The acquisition was not a success for K12 either. Prior to announcing the acquisition of Galvanize during the January 27, 2019 earnings call,<sup><a id=\"ftnt_ref85\" href=\"#ftnt85\">[85]<\/a><\/sup><span class=\"c3 c2\"> K12\u2019s stock traded at $19.38. One day later, the stock declined by 15% to $16.62, making the acquisition a failed gambit to boost K12\u2019s stock, which was declining prior to the Galvanize acquisition. It\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Galvanize was overvalued by investors, who put too much cash into the business relative to what they earned in the acquisition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"c9\">The structural obstacles to scaling a bootcamp identified by this report will make it difficult for any bootcamp to achieve venture scale returns. This does not mean that short-term education is not a worthwhile endeavor or a viable business idea. Affordable alternatives to four year degrees are good and needed, and it\u2019s theoretically possible for bootcamps to turn a profit while providing high quality education. However, all the available information suggests it\u2019s difficult for bootcamps to be both profitable and to provide high quality education while growing at a rapid pace. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a scenario where a coding bootcamp is a good venture capital investment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"c6\"><strong>February 13, 2020<\/strong>: Report
