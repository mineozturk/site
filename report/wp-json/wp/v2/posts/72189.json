Here are more than 150 online courses to help. While most courses are useful for everyone, some are particularly aimed towards young people, while others explain how to apply for a new job later in life.<\/p>\n<p>Class Central founder and CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@dhawal\">Dhawal Shah<\/a> wrote about an online course that helped him <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coding-interviews-stanford-courses\/\">ace a technical interview<\/a> and land a job in Silicon Valley in 2012. While many online courses teach technical skills, there are also plenty to help you write your resume and succeed at interviews, plus help you identify and develop skills important for the careers of today and tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Soft skills are highly valued by employers in a range of occupations. You can find courses in communication, negotiation and dealing with conflict, problem solving, creative thinking and related skills. Learn effective strategies to build your network and use it to improve your chances of landing that new position or thrive in your current one.<\/p>\n<p>And on a different note, applying for endless jobs can be a depressing business.

We need to foster effective collaboration rather than have those differences lead to misunderstandings and conflict. The ideas that we generate, individually or collectively, will be evaluated by others, such as bosses, funders, and customers. These audiences will likely have different concerns when they hear about your ideas and are likely to evaluate ideas differently than you do. We need to pitch our ideas in ways that get others excited about them, rather than bored or confused, so that we can expand the group of collaborators in our creative efforts.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/requirements-specification-goals-9807\"><b>Requirements Specifications: Goals and Conflict Analysis<\/b><\/a><br \/>\n<i>University of Colorado System via Coursera<\/i><br \/>\nIn Requirements Goal Development and Language Analysis, we move from the spoken word to precise writing.
