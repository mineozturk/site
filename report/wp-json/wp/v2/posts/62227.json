However, in 2015, MOOC providers have started targeting high schoolers with the intentions of closing the college readiness gap, helping\u00a0students to get a taste of different majors through introductory courses, and providing exam preparation (like AP) courses.Two specific MOOC providers are leading the charge: edX and FutureLearn.<\/p>\n<h2>Five Reasons High School Students Should Consider MOOCs<\/h2>\n<p>Earlier this year,\u00a0Grace Headinger, a senior at Maggie Walker\u2019s Governor School in Richmond, VA, provided a first-hand perspective on some of these MOOCs. Here are the main reasons high schoolers should consider MOOCs:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">1. to help prepare for AP exams,<br \/>\n2. to get a feel for potential schools,<br \/>\n3. to start exploring majors,<br \/>\n4. to gain perspectives from other geographies and backgrounds, and<br \/>\n5. to expand one\u2019s horizons.<\/p>\n<p>Dig deeper into each of these reasons by <a title=\"Five Reasons High School Students Should Consider MOOCs\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/five-reasons-high-schoolers-consider-taking-moocs\/\">reading our article here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>edX&#8217;s High School Initiative<\/h2>\n<p>Last year, in September 2014, edX announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/high-school-initiative\">High School Initiative\u00a0<\/a>with over 26 courses for high schoolers. This year that number of courses has expanded to 59.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/edX-High-School-Initiative.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1299\" height=\"812\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62229\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/edX-High-School-Initiative.jpg\" alt=\"edX High School Initiative\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/edX-High-School-Initiative.jpg 1299w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/edX-High-School-Initiative-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/edX-High-School-Initiative-1024x640.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1299px) 100vw, 1299px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>&#8220;By expanding our course offerings to include high school-level and introductory courses, we hope to help close the college readiness gap and empower younger learners \u2013 regardless of geography or socioeconomic status.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.edx.org\/how-bring-less-educated-learners-moocs\" target=\"_blank\">edX<\/a><span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Most of the courses in the High School Initiative are being created by universities like Rice, UC Berkeley, MIT, Cornell, and others. But edX has also partnered with\u00a0St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School and\u00a0Weston High School, both of which have created AP exam preparation\u00a0courses for edX.<\/p>\n<p>With these courses, edX is hoping to shift the usual demographic make-up of MOOCS from an older, degree-holding audience to younger audiences who do not yet possess a degree. Some early numbers show an improvement in that direction. The numbers also show a higher percentage of female students in these MOOCs, thereby closing the MOOC\u00a0gender gap.

The idea was that these courses would help students gain new skills and, crucially, have something around which they could build their all-important UCAS personal statement \u2014 indeed, it&#8217;s meant as a &#8220;selling point&#8221; that would make their personal statement stand out from the crowd.
