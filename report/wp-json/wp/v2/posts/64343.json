We also looked at the role that social networks and mobile apps can now play in learning and practicing the arts. We also touched on how Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Machine Learning (or AI) are beginning to change online education. In this final installment we\u2019ll dig deeper into computer-based techniques for teaching and evaluating student work. First we\u2019ll talk some about curriculum design, less specifically about music or even art, but I promise that we\u2019ll loop back to grading and music by the end.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wHwzRZColMc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"video-description\">Intro Video for Dr. Cook&#8217;s Kadenze MOOC<\/p>\n<p><strong>How We Teach: Curriculum Design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Online education must be much more than just putting a camera in the back of a classroom, taping lectures, maybe adding graphics, and posting videos. We can teach better, tell engaging stories, embed demos, links and other resources, use in-video quizzes, and grab\/retain more students. Good professional videos are important, and tech-wise, a good video player interface is essential. This should include rewind, \u00bd speed and 2x (or faster) video playback, along with closed captions. Couple this with in-video quiz questions, and we\u2019ve gone a long way toward helping different types of students learn at their own pace, while still guaranteeing that they\u2019re watching AND getting the important concepts.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Every \u201clecture\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be an hour long! And every \u201cweek\u201d doesn\u2019t need to have exactly three lectures. <span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After over 30 years of conventional teaching, I had a wonderful realization when creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kadenze.com\/courses\/physics-based-sound-synthesis-for-games-and-interactive-systems\/info\">my own Kadenze class<\/a>. Every \u201clecture\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be an hour long! And every \u201cweek\u201d doesn\u2019t need to have exactly three lectures. Some weekly sessions need over 2 hours total video time, while others are more like an hour. It\u2019s totally freeing to cover what needs to be covered, and send the students off to work on their assignments and projects. Breaking videos up into small 2-10 minute chunks is really important. We live in a world where the most popular online articles take 3-6 minutes to read, so allowing our learners to drop in and move forward in a course at their own time and pace is essential.<\/p>\n<p>And we have to make our courses interesting and fun. In the creative coding world, <a href=\"http:\/\/shiffman.net\">Dan Shiffman<\/a>\u00a0of NYU and the <a href=\"https:\/\/processingfoundation.org\/\">Processing Foundation<\/a> is a master of this. Dan has made and offered courses and modules to teach Processing since 2012, and he\u2019s always churning out <a href=\"http:\/\/codingrainbow.com\">new videos and initiatives<\/a>. When I visited him at NYU, I was amazed that his faculty office IS a green-screen video production studio.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/O6IwAi0_peY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"video-description\">Intro video for Dan Shiffman&#8217;s Coding Rainbow YouTube channel<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of green screens, one of the ways that online video teaching can differ from the classroom is in the use of motion graphics, special effects, and artful editing. Like it or not, since online courses live in the internet world, we must compete with kitty videos on YouTube, or whatever Kanye is doing. A teacher, seated at their office desk, with a webcam pointed up their nose, with\u00a0annoying background noise and bad lighting, might have been OK\u00a0in the early days of MOOCs, but no more. We must make our videos and coursework as interesting, artful, and professional as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How We Evaluate: Testing, Grades, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Education has always relied on one or more forms of testing. Pop quizzes with a midterm and final. Weekly homeworks and a big final project. Just these very words induce strong post-traumatic anxiety in many. Fortunately, online education gives us a variety of different models for approaching assessment, verification, and certification.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cMassive\u201d in MOOC means that we may have to deal with education and assessments at scale. For open online courses, 10,000 students enrolling and submitting the first assignment can mean disaster if humans are expected to do the grading. Peer assessment or grading is an option, but students don\u2019t necessarily trust each other, or themselves, to do a task that teachers and teaching assistants have traditionally done.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>I often try to provide one funny incorrect answer as part of multiple choice, or make the questions amusing<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I already talked about in-video quizzes, which are a cool way to keep students engaged and ensure that they\u2019re learning the important concepts. To make it interesting, I often try to provide one funny incorrect answer as part of multiple choice, or make the questions amusing. I also try to put some extra instruction and useful\/ interesting facts into the questions, so the student is always learning and engaged. Figure 1 shows a quiz question from my course.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/QuizQuestionAshtonKutcher.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64421\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/QuizQuestionAshtonKutcher.jpg\" alt=\"QuizQuestionAshtonKutcher\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/QuizQuestionAshtonKutcher.jpg 817w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/QuizQuestionAshtonKutcher-300x270.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/QuizQuestionAshtonKutcher-768x692.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" \/><\/a><em>Figure 1 A well designed quiz question can assess, teach, and amuse.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With some thought up front, and computer assistance, large parts of many courses can be graded at scale. We\u2019ve found that for many courses, starting with machine-graded assignments, then moving toward some peer grading\/critique, is a good mix. By the mid+ point of the course, the pool of serious students has usually stabilized, and they know and trust each other more from discussion forums. We\u2019ve also found that a gentler \u201cGallery Critique\u201d rather than strict \u201cPeer Grading\u201d is another useful term and mechanism for assessment. Figure 2 shows student gallery critiques from an illustration course.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GalleryCritiqueImage.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64423\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GalleryCritiqueImage.jpg\" alt=\"GalleryCritiqueImage\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GalleryCritiqueImage.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GalleryCritiqueImage-300x159.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GalleryCritiqueImage-768x408.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GalleryCritiqueImage-1024x544.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/a><em>Figure 2 \u00a0Required \u201cGallery Critiques\u201d can be an effective means of both grading and engaging.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>But Is Machine Grading Fair?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Proper grading algorithms don\u2019t carry any inherent bias. No teacher\u2019s pets. No \u201cthat kid bugs me.\u201d<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Short answer, Yep! Longer answer: Well designed computer algorithms, combined with well- structured assignments (ask the right questions, clearly), are certainly more consistent, and thus fairer, than a large pool of Instructor(s) and student Teaching Assistants. Proper grading algorithms don\u2019t carry any inherent bias. No teacher\u2019s pets. No \u201cthat kid bugs me.\u201d Algorithms don\u2019t wake up hung over, giving themselves 1 hour to grade 50 assignments because they want to meet friends for lunch. I could go on, but your next likely (and valid) question might be might be \u201cwhat about creativity, and human feedback?\u201d We\u2019ll get to that shortly.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously there are things that computers do much better than humans &#8212; counting words, computing the exact length of a submitted music composition sound file, or detecting similarities and minor differences in huge batches of similar files. Plagiarism detection via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/plagiarism\">Grammarly.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plagscan.com\/plagiarism-check\/\">PlagScan.com,<\/a> and other services is now commonly used for grading traditional university coursework, and for good reason, because <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/life\/shopping\/2001\/12\/adventures_in_cheating.html\">sources for buying term papers online<\/a> have been around for a long time now. Grammarly, and other software like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hemingwayapp.com\/\">Hemingway App<\/a> can help us write better, and target a specific reading level. Similar lexicon and grammar analysis tools can be used to grade essays and other long-form writing, and services like <a href=\"http:\/\/turnitin.com\/\">turnitin.com<\/a> provide \u201cautomated assessment of writing at scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There is also a split workload model, where a computer algorithm groups all similar responses for a given question or task, then humans can then grade them in bulk. A new company called <a href=\"http:\/\/engineering.berkeley.edu\/2016\/01\/gradescope-taking-pain-out-grading\">Gradescope<\/a>\u00a0provides exactly that service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Back to Art and Music<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But what about grading creative arts coursework? As mentioned, gallery critiques and peer assessments are good tools, but there is also quite a lot that computer algorithms can do. There\u2019s a research community called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ismir.net\/\">International Society for Music Information Retrieval<\/a> that has been looking at \u201cmachine listening\u201d topics for a long time now. In Part 2 of this series, we already looked at some music teaching\/assessment tools such as SmartMusic. Many years ago, Ajay Kapur, myself, Jordan Hochenbaum, Owen Vallis, and some others started thinking about this topic as applied to the education space. The result was Kadenze, and the graders we\u2019ve constructed extend beyond music and sound, to photos, arbitrary images such as hand drawn and lettered pages (comics!), and videos.<\/p>\n<p>Figure 3 shows the results of machine listening applied to a student composition (a submitted sound file). The \u201crobot\u201d has automatically found and marked the four main sections of the piece, and determined that part of the intro (first) section sounds most similar to the ending section. If the submitted composition had only 1 section, or 100, it would not pass the required submission criteria. This \u201csong\u201d clearly has the requisite form, and variety. Whether it\u2019s a hit or not is up to humans and the marketplace, but the robot likes it a lot.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/figure3-image.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64424\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/figure3-image.png\" alt=\"figure3-image\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/figure3-image.png 588w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/figure3-image-300x180.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" \/><\/a><em>Figure 3: Robot grader automatically finds and mark sections of student composition.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I think the future is super bright for tools such as these, and as computers get faster and cloud computing gets cheaper, there are huge possibilities for real-time interaction, tutoring, and grading. So it\u2019s possible to start thinking about \u201crobot teachers\u201d or at least something like automated TA office hours, or critique sessions composed of machine learning algorithms trained from the works of the masters, or from past submissions for a given course.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, humans have to select and design the curriculum, create the assignments, write and train the graders, etc. And I hope the final arbiter of great art works will always be humans. But the ability to offer arts courses to millions of students around the world is well worth embracing some new and potentially scary technologies. Personally, I\u2019m in, because I don\u2019t want to grade ten thousand homeworks per week \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><b>Perry R.
