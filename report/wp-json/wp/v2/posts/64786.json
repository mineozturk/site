Udacity provides the usual multiple choice and in-video quizzes, but all the projects that count towards completion of a Nanodegree are graded by humans.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity has built an Uber-like system in which previous Nanodegree graduates around the world grade current projects. And they get paid to do it. <a href=\"https:\/\/inc42.com\/startups\/edtech-startup-udacity-courses\/\">According to Shernaz Daver<\/a>, Chief Marketing Officer at Udacity, graders can make as much as $28K in a month.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Indeed!

The system allows Udacity to create open-ended assignments and projects which gets\u00a0graded quickly. Peer reviews on other platforms cannot compare to this experience.<\/p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidjoyner.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Learning@Scale2016-U-20160222-Final.pdf\">paper published<\/a> by David Joyner, around 300 projects are graded every day, and 61,000 projects have been evaluated in 12 months, with 50% evaluated within 2.5 hours (and 88% within 24 hours) of submission. Oliver Cameron, a Udacity VP, talks about how this system came about (back in 2015) on his <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@olivercameron\/how-a-udacity-graduate-earns-11k-a-month-reviewing-code-c2a7d295724c#.ljch14bam\">Medium blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>13,000 currently students enrolled in its Nanodegrees, 3000 graduates, and 900 have gotten jobs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":64945,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[641,103],"tags":[585,95,255],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.3 (Yoast SEO v18.5.1) -
