Out of 100 enrollments, only 70 learners ever start the course, and less than 10 complete the course successfully. Recent research suggests some reasons why so few people are able to complete a MOOC and points to some learners might use to boost their own chances of success. This article draws from research that was presented at the <a href=\"https:\/\/emoocs2019.eu\/\">EMOOCs 2019 Conference<\/a> in a session titled \u201cSelf-regulation and MOOCs.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p><strong><em>&#8216;<\/em><\/strong><em>There is a big difference between deciding to do something and actually doing it.<\/em><strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong> <em>&#8211; <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-agile-leadership-principles-11920\"><em>Agile Leadership Principles<\/em><\/a><em>, University of Maryland via edX<\/em><span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/ceur-ws.org\/Vol-2356\/research_short1.pdf\">Recent research on self-directed learning<\/a> shows that more than half of all learners are not prepared to learn in a MOOC. One study measured MOOC readiness using a Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) with a focus on self-management, desire for learning, and self-control. According to that study, only 47.5% of learners are ready to take a MOOC.<\/p>\n<p>Another study concluded that <a href=\"http:\/\/ceur-ws.org\/Vol-2356\/research_short12.pdf\">learners with stronger self-regulated learning skills are more active during MOOCs<\/a>. They are more likely to revisit course materials and tend to use a more flexible approach to organize their learning process.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-030-19875-6_8\">Research into the process of goal setting and achievement among MOOC learners<\/a> looked at learner behavior during the four phases of the Rubicon Model: pre-decisional, pre-actional, actional, and post-actional. In the remainder of this article, I explore the Rubicon Model framework and propose a few tips for learners, based on the research on self-directed learning.<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>&#8220;What kind of actions do you undertake as a learner after you decide you want to gain certain knowledge or skills?&#8221;<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-69190\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/four_phases_rubicon_table.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/four_phases_rubicon_table.png 975w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/four_phases_rubicon_table-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/four_phases_rubicon_table-768x124.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Phase #1: Pre-Decisional Phase<\/h2>\n<p>During the <strong>pre-decisional phase,<\/strong> as a potential MOOC-learner, you contemplate whether a MOOC fits your needs. You make a (first) decision about what you intend to do in the MOOC. Intentions range from browsing a few modules to completing the full course and earning a certificate. You may also have alternative goals such as connecting with other participants in the course or exploring possibilities to work with other organisations. Importantly, most learners intend to finish the MOOC.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tips at this stage:<\/strong> <\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Take time to select your course.<\/strong> Look for alternatives, and choose the course that teaches the skills you need to learn. <\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Define your goals and write them down.<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Choose which tools you will use to guide you through the self-directed learning process.<\/strong>These tools can be simply a notebook and pen, your favourite to-do app, or a dedicated app for MOOC learning. <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/moocnager\/enongknmhocjmpcigcombeolnefoilmg\"><em>MOOCnager<\/em><\/a><em>, a plug-in for the Google Chrome browser developed at Universidad Carlos III Madrid, helps learners set goals, organize their time, and reflect on their performance. The plug-in only works with edX MOOCs, but it is certainly worth a try.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Phase #2: Pre-Actional Phase<\/h2>\n<p>In the <strong>pre-actional phase<\/strong> you plan concrete strategies for achieving your set goals. You address issues such as when, where and how learning will take place and what action to take if something interferes with your initial planning, for example when assignments take longer than anticipated.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Tips at this stage:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Decide when to study for the MOOC.<\/strong> Will you study during the day? In the evenings? On weekends? Schedule your sessions. How many hours per week? Establish a weekly routine. Do you need to stop other activities to free up time for learning?<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Decide where to study. <\/strong>Will you study at home? In the office? While commuting? Establish a suitable study environment free of distractions. <\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Anticipate issues that could hinder your learning <\/strong>and develop a plan for addressing them if they arise. <\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Phase #3: Actional Phase<\/h2>\n<p>During the <strong>actional phase <\/strong>you execute the plan you defined in the pre-actional phase. You complete the learning tasks, monitor your progress and strive to keep up your engagement and motivation. During this stage, various disturbances may delay or even prevent you from reaching your goals. Researchers divide these factors into \u201cMOOC-related barriers\u201d and \u201cnon-MOOC related barriers.\u201d MOOC related barriers include lack of interaction, lack of instructor presence, and bad course content. Examples of non-MOOC related barriers include insufficient academic knowledge, lack of time, and technical issues such as poor internet connectivity or lack of digital skills.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Tips at this stage:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Revisit your goals weekly. <\/strong>Seek help from peers, instructors\/teaching assistants, or external tutors.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Look at<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/coursera-learning-how-to-learn-powerful-mental-tools-to-help-you-master-tough-subjects-2161\"><strong> Learning How To Learn<\/strong><\/a> for effective learning techniques.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Find additional<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-motivation-hacks\/\"><strong> MOOC Motivation Hacks<\/strong><\/a> to keep you on task.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Phase #4: Post-Actional Phase<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, in the <strong>post-actional phase<\/strong> you evaluate whether you have reached your goals. Did you achieve what you intended to achieve? Did the course meet your expectations? Taking the time to assess your efforts can help you in future courses.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Tips at this stage:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Reflect on whether the MOOC met your expectations.<\/strong> Were you able to learn in the MOOC according to your plan? Are you satisfied with the knowledge you gained?<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Define follow up actions.<\/strong> How can you practice the skills you learned? <\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Write a course review on Class Central <\/strong> to help others decide whether to take the course.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most people who enroll in a MOOC only think about what happens during the \u201cactional\u201d phase.\u00a0 However, preparation and reflection both contribute to learner success.
