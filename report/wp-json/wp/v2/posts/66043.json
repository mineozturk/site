The strong public interest in these courses caught everyone by surprise. More than 100,000 people signed up\u2014for each course.<\/p>\n<p>This led to a feeling of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) across higher education and Silicon Valley, both of whom invested huge amounts of capital and resources to launch free online courses without any concrete plans to recoup the costs (or get return on their investment). Within two years, more than<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/the-mooc-juggernaut-year-2\/\">\u00a0a 1,000 instructors from more than 150 universities<\/a>\u00a0had launched online courses.<\/p>\n<p>The media started calling this space MOOCs or Massive Open Online Courses, a term coopted from a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.chronicle.com\/blogs\/wiredcampus\/more-open-teaching-courseswhat-they-could-mean-for-colleges\/4269\">2008 experiment<\/a>. The narrative in early days of MOOC space was around the disruption of universities. The Internet had finally come after its latest victim\u2014higher education. Sebastian Thrun, co-founder of Udacity,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2012\/03\/ff-aiclass\/\">\u00a0famously predicted<\/a>\u00a0that in 50 years there would be only 10 higher education institutions. Not all MOOC providers shared this narrative, but this was the one that the media stuck with it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, more than five years later, we know this is not the case. I started\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\">Class Central<\/a>\u00a0at the end of Nov 2011 as a side project to keep track of free online courses, so I\u2019ve followed the space closely right from the beginning. MOOC providers have learned a lot in the last five years, and they\u2019re now more certain about who their real audience is\u2014and they\u2019re not the dabblers and lifelong learners who take courses just for curiosity\u2019s sake.<\/p>\n<p>In my\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2016-12-29-monetization-over-massiveness-breaking-down-moocs-by-the-numbers-in-2016\">last year\u2019s analysis\u00a0<\/a>of the MOOC space, I concluded that there\u2019s been a decisive shift by MOOC providers to focus on \u201cprofessional\u201d learners who are taking these courses for career-related outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>At the recently concluded\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/emoocs.eu\/emoocs-2017-conference\/\">EMOOCs conference<\/a>, the then CEO of Coursera, Rick Levin, shared his thoughts on this shift. He thinks that MOOCs may not have disrupted the education market, but they are disrupting the labor market. The real audience is not the traditional university student but what he calls the \u201clifelong career learner,\u201d someone who might be well beyond their college years and takes these online courses with the goal of achieving professional and career growth.<\/p>\n<p>Levin defined the lifelong career learner as someone typically between the age of 25 to 45. Eighty-nine percent of Coursera learners are over the age of 22.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">89% of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/coursera?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@coursera<\/a> learners are over the age of 22 <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/cGp0qmVMUW\">pic.twitter.com\/cGp0qmVMUW<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Dhawal Shah (@dhawalhshah) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dhawalhshah\/status\/869660673919275008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2017<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Traditional lifelong learners might learn due to their love of learning, but in the case of lifelong career learners, the \u201clifelong\u201d part is driven by the necessity of constantly adapting to the changing job market. Learning for the sake of learning sounds appealing, but, at least anecdotally, I hear from many people find they are more likely to make significant progress or even complete a course when they are tied to professional outcomes (that\u2019s certainly my experience).<\/p>\n<p>To target professional learners, MOOC providers started creating content in high-demand skills and launched their own proprietary credentials. Coursera for instance, took control of its catalog by incentivizing universities to launch Specializations (Coursera\u2019s micro-credential) in certain topics. They put out a proposal with a list of specializations that its member universities could bid on. The winning bids would receive a monetary grant of $100,000 to create Specializations. The grant money would be recovered out of the Specialization revenues.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that just launching these credentials wasn\u2019t enough to get learners to pay. So over time to increase the number of people converting to paying customers, the range of features and experiences that were once free have\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2017-04-20-moocs-started-out-completely-free-where-are-they-now\">dramatically shrunk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"671\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66044\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/EMOOCS-2017-Rick-Levin-University-Ecosystem.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Level University Ecosystem\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/EMOOCS-2017-Rick-Levin-University-Ecosystem.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/EMOOCS-2017-Rick-Levin-University-Ecosystem-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/EMOOCS-2017-Rick-Levin-University-Ecosystem-768x429.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/EMOOCS-2017-Rick-Levin-University-Ecosystem-1024x573.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But there are more-efficient ways to target professional learners than trying to sign them up one at a time. Coursera and other providers can sign students up in bulk by reaching them through corporations who generally have huge training budgets for employees. Skillsoft, an e-learning provider that exclusively sells to businesses, claims to have 400 million learners including 65 percent of Fortune 500 companies.<\/p>\n<p>The market size for corporate learning is easily in the tens of billions of dollars annually\u2014and maybe even bigger than the direct-to-consumer market that MOOC providers started out in. It still early days, but Coursera claims to have more than 50 enterprises using its Coursera for Business product.<\/p>\n<p>But at the center of all this is still the traditional university. Though MOOC providers have started partnering with companies to create their courses, those are usually limited to teaching learners how to use the company&#8217;s own products or simply a branding exercise. Both Levin and Simon Nelson, CEO of another MOOC platform called FutureLearn, reiterated at EMOOCs how MOOC providers are not an alternative to traditional colleges, but a strategic partner.<\/p>\n<p>Nelson was previously involved in the digital transformation of a media giant (the BBC), where he also helped launched its iPlayer. He sees FutureLearn\u2019s role through a similar lens\u2014not just as a MOOC provider but as \u201ca catalyst and an enabler of our partners digital transformation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Helping universities put their courses online or earning\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-for-credit\/\">academic credit for MOOCs<\/a>\u00a0is only the beginning. MOOC Providers also want to help\u2014and convince\u2014universities to put their entire\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-based-masters-degree\/\">degrees online<\/a>. Early this year, edX announced its first master&#8217;s degree in partnership with Georgia Tech. Coursera plans to have up to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-hec-paris-masters-degree\/\">20 online degrees<\/a>\u00a0by the end of 2019. FutureLearn just announced that UK\u2019s Coventry University will offer 50 post-graduate degrees on its platform. Last year it partnered with Australia\u2019s Deakin University, which announced seven post-graduate degrees.<\/p>\n<p>One of the lessons I learned from running Class Central is that to make money, you need to make others money. By targeting professional learners, MOOC providers are trying to exactly do that.<\/p>\n<p>To better serve this audience, every MOOC provider has launched products that range from tens of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. As a professional learner, I feel a certain amount of comfort knowing that high-quality educational material exists for skills that I would want to learn in the future. But if you are true lifelong learner\u2014the ones that helped start all the hype in the first place\u2014the MOOC experience has largely been reduced to basically a YouTube playlist with a cumbersome user interface.<\/p>\n<p>Unless, of course, you are willing to pay.<\/p>\n<p><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">My post first appeared on\u00a0<\/em><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2017-07-06-moocs-find-their-audience-professional-learners-and-universities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2017-04-20-moocs-started-out-completely-free-where-are-they-now\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">EdSurge<\/em><\/a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.
