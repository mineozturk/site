This included 8 weeks worth of content. Mid-way a \u2018free\u2019 week (with no new content) held just the mid-term. The concluding week 10, was a brief wrap-up video\/email as well as the final. The current version of the course, running Dec. 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015, is entirely self-paced. All work must be completed by the May 31st deadline. (Maybe I\u2019ll see you there? I liked the course so much I\u2019ve volunteered to be a \u2018community TA\u2019 in the discussion forums, Feb. 2015-May 2015). What is the workload? To watch all the weekly videos, complete the weekly quizzes, try the week\u2019s happiness practice and skim a few of the suggested readings, I would plan on reserving 5-7 hours per week for the course. Depending on how much you want to review, weeks with exams (mid-term and a final) may require fewer hours. Beyond voluntary participation in the discussion boards, there is no writing, or other formal project.<\/p>\n<h2>Did it change your life?<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Impactful?\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 Certainly it changed my daily routines<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Impactful?\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 Certainly it changed my daily routines.\u00a0 My family now mediates each evening.\u00a0 I try to remember to pull from my brain several times a day something I am grateful for, or take a moment to savor something I feel gratitude for (mint tea, hot shower, sunshine, electricity, my phone, not having a cold) and also try to gently ask my first-grade son, at the end of his day, what existed today that he feels gratitude for.\u00a0 I also try to practice self-compassion, and again, encourage self-compassion in my son.\u00a0 (Could it really be more important then self-esteem?\u00a0 Science feels it.)\u00a0 Did it make me a\u00a0happier\u00a0person?\u00a0 I don\u2019t have any scientific measures to demonstrate this.\u00a0 My\u00a0happiness\u00a0baseline is generally on the comparatively high side (my colleagues have more then once referred to me as Pollyanna).\u00a0 Anecdotally, my husband has said I seem a bit less tweaked about delivering high performance at work since beginning the nightly meditations two months ago.\u00a0 More happy, is my guess, with a side of reduced tension.<\/p>\n<h2>Any complaints?<\/h2>\n<p>I didn\u2019t find the discussion boards useful.\u00a0 Comments on the boards were usually self-reflective and brief.\u00a0 Also, there were so many comments!
